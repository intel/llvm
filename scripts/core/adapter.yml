details: |
    To be used after another entry-point has returned
    $X_RESULT_ERROR_ADAPTER_SPECIFIC in order to retrieve a message describing
    the circumstances of the underlying driver error and the error code
    returned by the failed driver entry-point.

    * Implementations *must* store the message and error code in thread-local
      storage prior to returning $X_RESULT_ERROR_ADAPTER_SPECIFIC.

    * The message and error code storage is will only be valid if a previously
      called entry-point returned $X_RESULT_ERROR_ADAPTER_SPECIFIC.

    * The memory pointed to by the C string returned in `ppMessage` is owned by
      the adapter and *must* be null terminated.

    * The application *may* call this function from simultaneous threads.

    * The implementation of this function *should* be lock-free.

    Example usage:

    ```cpp
    if ($xQueueCreate(hContext, hDevice, nullptr, &hQueue) ==
            $X_RESULT_ERROR_ADAPTER_SPECIFIC) {
        const char* pMessage;
        int32_t error;
        $xAdapterGetLastError(hAdapter, &pMessage, &error);
    }

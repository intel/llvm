Internal API Changes

These are major API changes that have happened since the 8.0.0 release of
Clang. If upgrading an external codebase that uses Clang as a library,
this section should help get you past the largest hurdles of upgrading.

Build System Changes
--------------------

These are major changes to the build system that have happened since the 8.0.0
release of Clang. Users of the build system should adjust accordingly.

- In 8.0.0 and below, the install-clang-headers target would install clang's
  resource directory headers. This installation is now performed by the
  install-clang-resource-headers target. Users of the old install-clang-headers
  target should switch to the new install-clang-resource-headers target.

libclang

- When `CINDEXTEST_INCLUDE_ATTRIBUTED_TYPES` is not provided when making a
  CXType, the equivalent type of the AttributedType is returned instead of the
  modified type if the user does not want attribute sugar. The equivalent type
  represents the minimally-desugared type which the AttributedType is
  canonically equivalent to.

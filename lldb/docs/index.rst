.. title:: Welcome to LLDB's documentation!

LLDB
====

LLDB is a next generation, high-performance debugger. It is built as a set of
reusable components which highly leverage existing libraries in the larger LLVM
Project, such as the Clang expression parser and LLVM disassembler.

LLDB is the default debugger in Xcode on Mac OS X and supports debugging C,
Objective-C and C++ on the desktop and iOS devices and simulator.

All of the code in the LLDB project is available under the standard
`LLVM License <http://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#copyright-license-and-patents>`__,
an open source "BSD-style" license.

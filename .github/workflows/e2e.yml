# The e2e workflow adds a comment to the pull request in the final step which
# requires the pull-request: write permission.
# When a pull request originates from a fork using the pull_request trigger
# will never grant write permissions due to security concerns.
# Instead, the pull_request_target trigger is necessary to be granted the
# pull-request: write permission.

name: Aggregate compute-benchmark averages from historical data

# The benchmarking workflow in sycl-linux-run-tests.yml passes or fails based on
# how the benchmark results compare to a historical average: This historical
# average is calculated in this workflow, which aggregates historical data and
# produces measures of central tendency (median in this case) used for this
# purpose.

          This sets the age limit of data used in average calculation: Any
          benchmark results created before `lookback_days` from today is
          excluded from being aggregated in the historical average.

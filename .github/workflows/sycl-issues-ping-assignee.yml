name: Ping issue assignees
# We have some specific pool of the issues we would like to handle. Sometimes
# the issue from this pool has an assignee, but doesn't get any updates for a
# long time. In this case it'd be useful to periodically ping the assignee.

# Note: may be we could use "actions/stale@v*", but I'm not sure if it's
# possible to not set the "stale" label at all. Even so, this action will not
# ping the assignee of the "stale" issue more than onсe.

# Note2: probably it'd be useful to have a small doc describing this "specific
# pool" to refer to.

          $assignee_logins, could you please take one of the following actions:
          - provide an update if you have any
          - unassign yourself if you're not looking / going to look into this issue
          - mark this issue with the 'confirmed' label if you have confirmed the problem/request and our team should work on it
          - close the issue if it has been resolved
          - take any other suitable action.

          Thanks!"

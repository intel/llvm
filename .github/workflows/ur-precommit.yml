# Note: this is the very first version of UR workflow.
# It was pretty much copy-pasted from UR repository.
# Over time it will be most likely integrated more into existing workflows.

# Note: the trigger is copy-pasted from sycl-linux-precommit.yml - probably to be fine-tuned.

  # We rely on "Fork pull request workflows from outside collaborators" -
  # "Require approval for all outside collaborators" at

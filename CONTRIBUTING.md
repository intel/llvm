## Contribution process

### Development

**NB**: For any changes not related to DPC++, but rather to LLVM in general, it
is strongly encouraged that you submit the patch to https://llvm.org/ directly.
See [LLVM contribution guidelines](https://llvm.org/docs/Contributing.html)
for more information.

- Create a personal fork of the project on GitHub
  - For the DPC++ Compiler project, use **sycl** branch as baseline for your
    changes. See [Get Started Guide](sycl/doc/GetStartedGuide.md).
- Prepare your patch
  - follow [LLVM coding standards](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html)
  - [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) and
    [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) tools can be
    integrated into your workflow to ensure formatting and stylistic
    compliance of your changes.
  - use

    ```bash
    ./clang/tools/clang-format/git-clang-format `git merge-base origin/sycl HEAD`
    ```

    to check the format of your current changes against the `origin/sycl`
    branch.
    - `-f` to also correct unstaged changes
    - `--diff` to only print the diff without applying
- Build the project following
[Get Started Guide instructions](sycl/doc/GetStartedGuide.md#build-dpc-toolchain).
- Run regression tests -
[instructions](sycl/doc/GetStartedGuide.md#test-dpc-toolchain).

### Commit message

- When writing your commit message, please make sure to follow
  [LLVM developer policies](
  https://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#commit-messages) on the subject.
- For any DPC++-related commit, the `[SYCL]` tag should be present in the
  commit message title. To a reasonable extent, additional tags can be used
  to signify the component changed, e.g.: `[PI]`, `[CUDA]`, `[Doc]`.

### Review and acceptance testing

- Create a pull request for your changes following [Creating a pull request
instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
- CI will run a signed-off check as soon as your PR is created - see the
**check_pr** CI action results.
- CI will run several build and functional testing checks as soon as the PR is
approved by an Intel representative.
  - A new approval is needed if the PR was updated (e.g. during code review).
- Once the PR is approved and all checks have passed, the pull request is
ready for merge.

### Merge

Project maintainers merge pull requests using one of the following options:

- [Rebase and merge] The preferable choice for PRs containing a single commit
- [Squash and merge] Used when there are multiple commits in the PR
  - Squashing is done to make sure that the project is buildable on any commit
- [Create a merge commit] Used for LLVM pull-down PRs to preserve hashes of the
commits pulled from the LLVM community repository

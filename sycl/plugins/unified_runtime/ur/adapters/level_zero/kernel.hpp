  // because kernels are cached in the context by SYCL RT and they are released
  // only during context object destruction. Regular RefCount is not usable to
  // track submissions because user/SYCL RT can retain kernel object any number

  // We store pointers to the elements because pointers are not invalidated by
  // insert/delete for std::unordered_map (iterators are invalidated). We need
  // to take a snapshot instead of just reference-counting the allocations,
  // because picture of active allocations can change during kernel execution
  // (new allocations can be added) and we need to know which memory allocations
  // were retained by this kernel to release them (and don't touch new
  // allocations) at kernel completion. Same kernel may be submitted several
  // times and retained allocations may be different at each submission. That's
  // why we have a set of memory allocations here and increase ref count only
  // once even if kernel is submitted many times. We don't want to know how many
  // times and which allocations were retained by each submission. We release
  // all allocations in the set only when SubmissionsCount == 0.

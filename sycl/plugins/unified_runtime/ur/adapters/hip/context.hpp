/// UR context mapping to a HIP context object.
///
/// There is no direct mapping between a HIP context and a UR context.
/// The main differences are described below:
///
/// <b> HIP context vs UR context </b>
///
/// One of the main differences between the UR API and the HIP driver API is
/// that the second modifies the state of the threads by assigning
/// `hipCtx_t` objects to threads. `hipCtx_t` objects store data associated
/// with a given device and control access to said device from the user side.
/// UR API context are objects that are passed to functions, and not bound
/// to threads.
/// The ur_context_handle_t_ object doesn't implement this behavior. It only
/// holds the HIP context data. The RAII object \ref ScopedDevice implements
/// the active context behavior.
///
/// <b> Primary vs UserDefined context </b>
///
/// HIP has two different types of context, the Primary context,
/// which is usable by all threads on a given process for a given device, and
/// the aforementioned custom contexts.
/// The HIP documentation, and performance analysis, suggest using the Primary
/// context whenever possible. The Primary context is also used by the HIP
/// Runtime API. For UR applications to interop with HIP Runtime API, they have
/// to use the primary context - and make that active in the thread. The
/// `ur_context_handle_t_` object can be constructed with a `kind` parameter
/// that allows to construct a Primary or `UserDefined` context, so that
/// the UR object interface is always the same.
///
///  <b> Destructor callback </b>
///
///  Required to implement CP023, SYCL Extended Context Destruction,
///  the UR Context can store a number of callback functions that will be
///  called upon destruction of the UR Context.
///  See proposal for details.
///  https://github.com/codeplaysoftware/standards-proposals/blob/master/extended-context-destruction/index.md

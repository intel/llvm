# Working on a release branch

Release branch is defined as a branch whose name starts with `sycl-rel-` prefix.

Those branches are intended to indicate stable snapshots of our product so that
our users don't need to guess which nightly build is good enough for our needs.

Therefore, those branches have higher quality requirements and as such have
different contribution rules intended to preserve their stability.

If you are not familiar with [general contribution guidelines][contributing] or
[DPC++ specific contribution guidelines][contributing-to-dpcpp], please
familiarize yourself with those documents first because they also apply to
release branches.

## Extra rules for release branches

### Only cherry-picks are allowed

It is assumed, that everything you do on a release branch, should also be
repeated on the main branch to ensure that it is automatically included into
future releases.

Therefore, when submitting a PR to a release branch, its description should
contain a link to the corresponding PR in the main `sycl` branch.

Note that it is not acceptable to first merge something into a
release branch and then apply it to the main `sycl` branch. The flow goes in
the opposite direction where you first land a patch to the main branch and then
backport it to a release branch.

### No new features are allowed

Features are generally more complicated then bug fixes and may require further
bug fixes as well. Considering that release branches are intended to be stable,
no new features are allowed to be added there.

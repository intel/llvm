# Contributing to DPC++

## Maintaining stable ABI/API

All changes made to the DPC++ compiler and runtime library should generally
preserve existing ABI/API and contributors should avoid making incompatible
changes. One of the exceptions is experimental APIs, clearly marked so by
namespace or related specification.

Another exceptional case is the transition from SYCL 1.2.1 to SYCL 2020
standard.

Deprecation of older APIs is happening in the following order:

- Newer API implemented and covered with tests
- Deprecation warning is added to older API
- Wait some time allowing users to migrate their codebases (exact period depends
  on the change made)
- Old API is removed in headers
- Old API is removed in library

See [ABI Policy Guide](ABIPolicyGuide.md) for more information.

## Project build and local testing

See [Get Started Guide instructions](../GetStartedGuide.md)

## Commit message

For any DPC++-related commit, the `[SYCL]` tag should be present in the
commit message title. To a reasonable extent, additional tags can be used
to signify the component changed, e.g.: `[PI]`, `[CUDA]`, `[Doc]`.

## Tests development

Every product change should be accompanied with corresponding test modification
(adding new test(s), extending, removing or modifying existing test(s)).

There are 3 types of tests which are used for DPC++ toolchain validation:
* DPC++ in-tree tests
* DPC++ end-to-end (E2E) tests
* SYCL Conformance Test Suite (CTS)

### DPC++ in-tree tests

DPC++ in-tree tests are hosted in this repository. They can be run by
[check-llvm](/llvm/test), [check-clang](/clang/test),
[check-llvm-spirv](/llvm-spirv/test) and [check-sycl](/sycl/test) targets.
These tests are expected not to have hardware (e.g. GPU, FPGA, etc.) or
external software (e.g. OpenCL, Level Zero, CUDA runtimes) dependencies. All
other tests should land at DPC++ end-to-end or SYCL CTS tests.

Generally, any functional change to any of the DPC++ toolchain components
should be accompanied by one or more tests of this type when possible. They
allow verifying individual components and tend to be more lightweight than
end-to-end or SYCL-CTS tests.

#### General guidelines

- Use `sycl::` namespace instead of `sycl::`

- Add a helpful comment describing what the test does at the beginning and
  other comments throughout the test as necessary.

- All identifiers used in `llvm/sycl` headers files must contain at
  least one lowercase letter due to avoid conflicts with user-defined macros.

- Try to follow descriptive naming convention for variables, functions as
  much as possible. Please refer to
  [LLVM naming convention](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html#name-types-functions-variables-and-enumerators-properly)

#### DPC++ clang FE tests

- Include sycl mock headers as system headers.
  Example: `-internal-isystem %S/Inputs`

  ```C++
  `#include "sycl.hpp"`
  ```

- Use SYCL functions for invoking kernels from the mock header
  `(single_task, parallel_for, parallel_for_work_group)`
  Example:

  ```C++
  `#include "Inputs/sycl.hpp"`
  sycl::queue q;
  q.submit([&](sycl::handler &h) {
  h.single_task( { //code });
  });
  ```

#### DPC++ headers and runtime tests

- [check-sycl](/sycl/test) target contains 2 types of tests: LIT tests and
  unit tests. LIT tests make compile-time checks of DPC++ headers, e.g. device
  code IR verification, static_assert tests. Unit tests check DPC++ runtime
  behavior and do not perform any device code compilation, instead relying on
  redefining plugin API with [PiMock](/sycl/unittests/helpers/PiMock.hpp) when
  necessary.

### DPC++ end-to-end (E2E) tests

These tests are extension to
[LLVM test suite](https://github.com/intel/llvm-test-suite/tree/intel/SYCL)
and hosted at separate repository.
A test which requires full stack including backend runtimes (e.g. OpenCL,
Level Zero or CUDA) should be added to DPC++ E2E test suite following
[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/intel/llvm-test-suite/blob/intel/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### SYCL Conformance Test Suite (CTS)

These tests are hosted at
[Khronos SYCL conformance tests](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SYCL-CTS).
These tests verify SYCL specification conformance. All implementation details
are out of scope for the tests.
See DPC++ compiler invocation definitions at
[FindIntel_SYCL](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SYCL-CTS/blob/SYCL-1.2.1/master/cmake/FindIntel_SYCL.cmake))

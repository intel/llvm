# Behavior for optional kernel features

This design document describes the changes that are needed in DPC++ in order to
conform to the SYCL 2020 specification regarding the behavior of applications
that use optional kernel features.  An optional kernel feature is any feature
that is supported by some devices and not by others.  For example, not all
devices support 16-bit floating point operations, so the `sycl::half` data type
is an optional kernel feature.  Some DPC++ extensions like AMX are also
optional kernel features.

The requirements for this design come mostly from the SYCL 2020 specification
[section 5.7 "Optional kernel features"][1] but they also encompass the C++
attribute `[[sycl::device_has()]]` that is described in [section 5.8.1 "Kernel
attributes"][2] and [section 5.8.2 "Device function attributes"][3].

## Definition of terms

### A kernel's static call graph

The term "static call graph" of a kernel means the set of all functions that
a kernel may call, including functions that are called transitively from other
functions.  In standard SYCL, device code is not allowed to contain function
pointers, virtual functions, or indirect function calls.  It is therefore easy
to compute the static call graph of a kernel.  By starting at the kernel
function itself (e.g.  the function passed to `parallel_for`), the compiler can
identify all functions called by that function, then it can find all functions
called by those functions, etc.  Depending on the tool which does the analysis,
the "static call graph" could include only those functions that reside in the
same translation unit as the kernel, or it could include all functions that
reside in the same executable image (or shared library) as the kernel.  In the
sections below, we try to make the distinction clear whenever we refer to a
kernel's static call graph.

We are contemplating a DPC++ extension that would allow some limited use of
function pointers in device code.  This feature is not yet fully defined or
supported.  We expect that the semantics of this feature will include some way
for the compiler to deduce a limited set of possible targets for each indirect
function call.  Therefore, it is still possible for the compiler to construct a
"static call graph" for each kernel, the only difference is that each call site
now adds a set of possible target functions to a kernel's static call graph.
The details about how this will work are expected to be included in the DPC++
extension specification that enables indirect function calls.

### An exported device function

The term "exported device function" means a device function that is exported
from a shared library as defined by [Device Code Dynamic Linking][4].

[4]: <SharedLibraries.md>

### The FE compiler

The term "FE compiler" refers to the entire DPC++ compiler chain that runs
when the user executes the `clang++` command.  This includes the clang
front-end itself, all passes over LLVM IR, the post-link tool, and any AOT
compilation phases (when the user compiles in AOT mode).  The FE compiler does
not include the JIT compiler which translates SPIR-V (or another IL format)
into native code when the application executes.


## Requirements

There are several categories of requirements covered by this design.  Each of
these is described in more detail in the sections that follow:

* The FE compiler must issue a diagnostic in some cases when a kernel or device
  function uses an optional feature.  However, the FE compiler must **not**
  generate a diagnostic in other cases.

* The runtime must raise an exception when a kernel using optional features
  is submitted to a device that does not support those features.  This
  exception must be raised synchronously from the kernel invocation command
  (e.g. `parallel_for()`).

* The runtime must not raise an exception (or otherwise fail) merely due to
  speculative compilation of a kernel for a device, when the application does
  not specifically submit the kernel to that device.


### Diagnostics from the FE compiler

In general, the FE compiler does not know which kernels the application will
submit to which devices.  Therefore, the FE compiler does not generally know
which optional features a kernel can legally use.  Thus, in general, the FE
compiler must not issue any diagnostic simply because a kernel uses an optional
feature.

The only exception to this rule occurs when the application uses the C++
attribute `[[sycl::device_has()]]`.  When the application decorates a kernel or
device function with this attribute, it is an assertion that the kernel or
device function is allowed to use only those optional features which are listed
by the attribute.  Therefore, the FE compiler must issue a diagnostic if the
kernel or device function uses any other optional kernel features.

The SYCL 2020 specification only mandates this diagnostic when a kernel or
device function that is decorated with `[[sycl::device_has()]]` uses an
optional kernel feature (not listed in the attribute), **and** when that use is
in the kernel's static call graph as computed for the translation unit that
contains the kernel function.  Thus, the compiler is not required to issue a
diagnostic if the use is in a `SYCL_EXTERNAL` function that is defined in
another translation unit.

Note that this behavior does not change when the compiler runs in AOT mode.
Even if the user specifies a target device via "-fsycl-targets", that does not
necessarily mean that the user expects all the code in the application to be
runnable on that device.  Consider an application that uses some middleware
library, where the library's header contains kernels optimized for different
devices.  An application should be able to compile in AOT mode with this
library without getting errors.  Therefore the AOT compiler must not fail
simply because the middleware header contains device code for devices that
are not being compiled for.


### Runtime exception if device doesn't support feature

When the application submits a kernel to a device via one of the kernel
invocation commands (e.g. `parallel_for()`), the runtime must check if the
kernel uses optional features that are not supported on that device.  If the
kernel uses an unsupported feature, the runtime must throw a synchronous
`errc::kernel_not_supported` exception.

When doing these checks, the runtime must consider all uses of optional
features in the kernel's static call graph, regardless of whether those uses
are in the same translation unit as the kernel and regardless of whether those
uses come from device code in a shared library.

This exception, however, is only required for features that are exposed via a
C++ type or function.  Examples of this include `sycl::half` or instantiating
`sycl::atomic_ref` for a 64-bit type.  If the kernel relies on optional
features that are more "notional" such as sub-group independent forward
progress (`info::device::sub_group_independent_forward_progress`), no exception
is required.

To further clarify, this exception must be thrown in the following
circumstances:

* For a kernel that is not decorated with `[[sycl::device_has()]]`, the
  exception must be thrown if the kernel uses a feature that the device does
  not support.

* For a kernel that is decorated with `[[sycl::device_has()]]`, the exception
  must be thrown if the device does not have the aspects listed in that
  attribute.  Note that the exception must be thrown even if the kernel does
  not actually use a feature corresponding to the aspect, and it must be
  thrown even if the aspect does not correspond to any optional feature.

* For a kernel that is decorated with `[[sycl::device_has()]]`, the FE compiler
  will mostly check (at compile time) whether the kernel uses any features that
  are not listed in the attribute.  However, this check only results in a
  warning, so the runtime is still responsible for throwing the exception if
  any of the functions called by the kernel uses an optional feature that the
  device does not support.

* For a kernel that is decorated with the `[[sycl::reqd_work_group_size(W)]]`
  or `[[sycl::reqd_sub_group_size(S)]]` attribute, the exception must be thrown
  if the device does not support the work group size `W` or the sub-group size
  `S`.

Note that the exception must be thrown synchronously, not delayed and thrown on
the queue's asynchronous handler.


### No runtime exception for speculative compilation

It is currently common for the runtime to speculatively compile some kernels.
For example, DPC++ may bundle all kernels from the same translation unit
together into a single device image.  When the application submits one kernel
*K* to a device *D*, the runtime actually compiles all kernels in *K*'s device
image for device *D*.  Let's assume in this example that the kernel *K* uses
only features that are supported by *D*.  It would be illegal for the runtime
to throw an exception in such a case just because some other kernel in the same
device image uses a feature that is not supported by device *D*.


### Compiler switch to diagnose optional feature usage

As noted above, the FE compiler does not generally know which kernels will be
submitted to which devices, and this limits the errors that the FE compiler can
diagnose.  However, some users may know that all code in their application will
run on some specific target device, and these users would prefer a compiler
diagnostic if any kernel uses a feature that is not compatible with that
device.  This is particularly true for FPGA users who always AOT compile their
application for a specific FPGA device.

To satisfy this use case, this design adds a new compile-time switch
`-fsycl-fixed-targets` which is an assertion by the user that all device code
in the translation unit is expected to be runnable on the specified target
device(s).

The definition of this switch is:

> `-fsycl-fixed-targets=target,target...`
>
> This switch may be passed on the compilation line as an assertion by the
> user that all device code in the source file (translation unit) is expected
> to be runnable on the target devices that are listed, and it will not be run
> on any other target device.  The compiler checks whether the device code uses
> any features that are incompatible with any of the listed devices.  If so,
> the compiler raises a diagnostic.
>
> This switch may be used either with or without the `-fsycl-targets` switch.
> When used without `-fsycl-targets`, the `-fsycl-fixed-targets` switch checks
> for kernels that use features that are not compatible with the listed target
> devices, but those kernels are still just-in-time (JIT) compiled when the
> application runs.  When used with `-fsycl-targets`, the compiler does the
> same checks, but it also compiles the kernels ahead-of-time (AOT).  When both
> switches are used together, it is typical to pass the same set of target
> devices to both switches.

In order for readers of this design document to better understand the
relationship between the target list in `-fsycl-fixed-targets` vs. the target
list in `-fsycl-targets`, consider a weird case where both switches are
specified with different target lists.  If `-fsycl-fixed-targets=X` is
specified on the command line, the compiler checks that all device code is
compatible with all targets in list `X`, so it issues a diagnostic if any of
that code uses a feature that is incompatible with any of those targets.  As
described below, this command line switch also provides certain guarantees
about how kernels in the translation unit are bundled together into device
images.

Let's further assume in our example that the `-fsycl-targets=Y` is also
specified on the command line.  This causes the compiler to AOT compile all
*eligible* device code for each target in `Y`.  However, the
`-fsycl-fixed-targets` switch indicates that the device code is only eligible
to run on targets in the `X` list.  As a result, the `-fsycl-targets` switch
will only AOT compile for the devices that are present in both lists (i.e. the
intersection of the two sets `X` and `Y`).


### Must preserve ability to precisely control device images

FPGA users need the ability to control how kernels are bundled together into
device images because an FPGA device is reprogrammed with the contents of a
single device image.  Most FPGA users want all kernels in their application to
be bundled into a single device image, so that they can all exist on the same
FPGA device at the same time.  Advanced users may want to partition some
kernels into one device image and other kernels into another device image,
allowing kernels to be programmed on two (or more) different FPGA devices.

FPGA users are accustomed to doing this via the `-fsycl-device-code-split`
link-time switch.  However, not all users agree on the semantic of this switch.
Whereas FPGA users see this switch as a hard requirement that controls the
way kernels are bundled into device images, other users see this switch as an
optimization that controls JIT-time overhead.  These users do not expect
`-fsycl-device-code-split` to ever produce incorrect code which could lead to
an exception at runtime.

To satisfy both users, the meaning of `-fsycl-device-code-split` is changed as
follows.  When used without `-fsycl-fixed-targets`, it specifies a minimum
granularity of splitting, but the implementation may perform additional device
code splits in order to preserve the correctness of the code.

However, when `-fsycl-device-code-split` is used in conjunction with
`-fsycl-fixed-targets`, we can guarantee that additional device code splits are
not needed for correctness.  Thus, when both switches are specified together,
the `-fsycl-device-code-split` provides the precise control over bundling of
kernels into device images that FPGA users expect.

Note that these switches are useful even for non-FPGA users.  For example,
non-FPGA users may want to use the `device_global` property
[`device_image_scope`][5], which requires even non-FPGA users to have precise
control over the way kernels are bundled into device images.

[5]: <../extensions/experimental/sycl_ext_oneapi_device_global.asciidoc#properties-for-device-global-variables>

The new definition of `-fsycl-device-code-split` is as follows:

> `-fsycl-device-code-split[=value]`
>
> This switch helps optimize the JIT time performance by adjusting the way
> kernels are grouped together into device images.  The value `off` places most
> kernels into one large device image, which avoids some duplicated code but
> results in all kernels being JIT compiled whenever one of them is submitted
> to a device.  The values `per_kernel` and `per_source` cause kernels to be
> split into multiple device images, which can avoid JIT overhead for kernels
> that are never submitted to a device.  However, these values can also cause
> common functions to be duplicated if they are shared by kernels in two or
> more device images.
>
> Normally, this switch specifies only a minimum granularity for device code
> splitting, and DPC++ may perform additional device code splits beyond those
> that are requested.  However, translation units that are compiled with
> `-fsycl-fixed-targets` have stricter guarantees.  All kernels from
> translation units that are compiled with the same set of targets are first
> logically bundled into the same device image.  Kernels in each of these
> device images are then split exactly as specified by
> `-fsycl-device-code-split`.  For example, when source files are compiled with
> `-fsycl-fixed-targets=X` and then linked with `-fsycl-device-code-split=off`,
> all kernels in those source files are guaranteed to be grouped into a single
> device image.
>
> The `value` can be any one of the following:
>
> `per_kernel`: Creates a separate device image for each SYCL kernel.  Each
> device image will contain a kernel and all its dependencies, such as called
> functions and used variables.
>
> `per_source`: Creates a separate device image for each source (translation
> unit).  Each device image will contain a collection of kernels grouped on a
> per-source basis and all their dependencies, such as all used variables and
> called functions, including the `SYCL_EXTERNAL` macro-marked functions from
> other translation units.
>
> `off`: Creates a single device image for all kernels.
>
> `auto`: The compiler will use a heuristic to select the best way of splitting
> device code.  This is the same as specifying `-fsycl-device-code-split` with
> no value.


## Design

### Changes to DPC++ headers

With the exception of the `[[sycl::reqd_work_group_size()]]` and
`[[sycl::reqd_sub_group_size()]]` attributes, all kernel optional features
are associated with some device aspect.  For example, the `sycl::half` type
is an optional feature which is only supported on devices that have the
`aspect::fp16` aspect.  We can therefore use device aspects as a way to
describe the set of optional features that a kernel uses (with the exception
of the required work-group or sub-group size).

As we will see later, it is helpful to decorate all APIs in DPC++ headers that
correspond to optional kernel features with a C++ attribute that identifies the
associated aspect.  We cannot use the `[[sycl::device_has()]]` attribute for
this purpose, though, because that attribute is allowed only for functions.
Instead, we invent a new internal attribute `[[sycl_detail::uses_aspects()]]`
that can be used to decorate both functions and types.  This attribute is not
documented for user code; instead it is an internal implementation detail of
DPC++.

Like all use of C++ attributes in the DPC++ headers, the headers should spell
the attribute using initial and trailing double underscores
(`[[__sycl_detail__::__uses_aspects__()]]`).  We show that form in the code
samples below, but this design document uses the form without the underbars
elsewhere.  Both forms refer to the same attribute.

To illustrate, the type `sycl::half` is an optional feature whose associated
aspect is `aspect::fp16`.  We therefore decorate the declaration like this:

```
namespace sycl::detail::half_impl {

class [[__sycl_detail__::__uses_aspects__(aspect::fp16)]] half {
/* ... */
};

} // namespace sycl::detail::half_impl;
```

This attribute is also used to decorate function declarations that correspond
to optional features.  Illustrating a hypothetical AMX extension:

```
[[__sycl_detail__::__uses_aspects__(aspect::ext_intel_amx)]]
void amx_multiply();
```

This attribute can also be used to decorate class templates where only certain
instantiations correspond to optional features.  See ["Appendix: Adding an
attribute to 8-byte `atomic_ref`"][6] for an illustration of how this attribute
can be used in conjunction with partial specialization to mark only certain
instantiations of `sycl::atomic_ref` as an optional feature.

[6]: <#appendix-adding-an-attribute-to-8-byte-atomic_ref>

Because the `[[sycl_detail::uses_aspects()]]` attribute is only needed for the
device compiler, the headers should protect it with
`#ifdef __SYCL_DEVICE_ONLY__`.  This avoids warnings when our headers are
compiled with a third-party host compiler.

Although the examples above show only a single aspect parameter to the
`[[sycl_detail::uses_aspects()]]` attribute, this attribute should support a
list of aspects, similar to the `[[sycl::device_has()]]` attribute.  This will
allow us to support future features that depend on a conjunction of aspects
(e.g. a feature that does atomic operations on 64-bit floating point values
might be decorated with
`[[sycl_detail::uses_aspects(aspect::fp64, aspect::atomic64)]]`).

Unfortunately, the fundamental type `double` is also an optional kernel
feature.  Since there is no type definition for `double` in the headers, there
is no convenient place to add an attribute.  Instead, the FE device compiler
must behave as though there was an implicit
`[[sycl_detail::uses_aspects(aspect::fp64)]]` attribute for any device code
that uses the `double` type.


### New LLVM IR metadata

In order to communicate the information from `[[sycl::device_has()]]` and
`[[sycl_detail::uses_aspects()]]` attributes to the DPC++ post-link tool, we
introduce several new LLVM IR metadata.

The named metadata `!sycl_types_that_use_aspects` conveys information about
types that are decorated with `[[sycl_detail::uses_aspects()]]`.  This metadata
is not referenced by any instruction in the module, so it must be looked up by
name.  The format looks like this:

```
!sycl_types_that_use_aspects = !{!0, !1, !2}
!0 = !{!"class.sycl::detail::half_impl::half", i32 8}
!1 = !{!"class.sycl::amx_type", i32 9}
!2 = !{!"class.sycl::other_type", i32 8, i32 9}
```

The value of the `!sycl_types_that_use_aspects` metadata is a list of unnamed
metadata nodes, each of which describes one type that is decorated with
`[[sycl_detail::uses_aspects()]]`.  The value of each unnamed metadata node
starts with a string giving the name of the type which is followed by a list of
`i32` constants where each constant is a value from `enum class aspect` telling
the numerical value of an aspect from the type's
`[[sycl_detail::uses_aspects()]]` attribute.  In the example above, the type
`sycl::detail::half_impl::half` uses an aspect whose numerical value is
`8` and the type `sycl::other_type` uses two aspects `8` and `9`.

**NOTE**: The reason we choose this representation is because LLVM IR does not
allow metadata to be attached directly to types.  This representation works
around that limitation by creating global named metadata that references the
type's name.

To synchronize the integral values of given aspects between the SYCL headers and
the compiler, the `!sycl_aspects` metadata is added to the module, based on the
values defined in the enum. Inside this metadata node, each value of the aspect
enum is represented by another metadata node with two operands; the name of the
value and the corresponding integral value. An example of this is:

```
!sycl_aspects = !{!0, !1, !2, ...}
!0 = !{!"host", i32 0}
!1 = !{!"cpu", i32 1}
!2 = !{!"gpu", i32 2}
...
```

**NOTE**: The `!sycl_aspects` metadata is both used by the compiler to identify
the aspect values of implicit aspect requirements, such as `aspect::fp64` from
the use of `double`, and to offer better diagnostic messages.

We also introduce three metadata that can be attached to a function definition:

* The `!sycl_declared_aspects` metadata is used for functions that are
  decorated with `[[sycl::device_has()]]`.  The value of the metadata node is a
  list of `i32` constants, where each constant is a value from
  `enum class aspect` representing the aspects listed in the attribute.

* The `!sycl_used_aspects` metadata is used to store the propagated
  information about all aspects used by a kernel or exported device function.
  The value of this metadata node is also a list of `i32` constants, where each
  constant is a value from `enum class aspect` representing the aspects that
  are used by the kernel or exported device function.

* The `!sycl_fixed_targets` metadata is used to decorate kernel functions and
  `SYCL_EXTERNAL` functions, telling the value of the `-fsycl-fixed-targets`
  switch that was used to compile the translation unit.  The value of this
  metadata node is a list of string literals corresponding to the list of
  targets specified on that command line switch.  If the translation unit is
  compiled without the `-fsycl-fixed-targets`, the metadata has an empty list.

  The reason an empty metadata is added to functions compiled without the
  command line switch is to aid with the error checking that happens in the
  `sycl-post-link` tool w.r.t. `SYCL_EXTERNAL` functions.  The presence of the
  empty metadata allows `sycl-post-link` to identify functions that are
  definitely known to be compiled without `-fsycl-fixed-targets`.  Functions
  with no metadata might be created by backend IR passes, even when this switch
  *is* specified.

To illustrate, the following IR corresponds to a function `foo` that is
decorated with `[[sycl::device_has()]]` where the required aspects have the
numerical values `8` and `9`.  In addition, the function uses an optional
feature that corresponds to an aspect with numerical value `8`.

```
define void @foo() !sycl_declared_aspects !1 !sycl_used_aspects !2 {}
!1 = !{i32 8, i32 9}
!2 = !{i32 8}
```


### Changes to the DPC++ front-end

The front-end of the device compiler is responsible for parsing the
`[[sycl::device_has()]]` and `[[sycl_detail::uses_aspects()]]` attributes and
transferring the information to the LLVM IR metadata described above according
to the following rules:

* If the translation unit contains any type definitions that are decorated with
  `[[sycl_detail::uses_aspects()]]`, the front-end creates an
  `!sycl_types_that_use_aspects` metadata describing the aspects used by all
  such types.

* If a function is decorated with `[[sycl_detail::uses_aspects()]]`, the
  front-end adds an `!sycl_used_aspects` metadata to the function's definition
  listing the aspects from that attribute.

* If a function is decorated with `[[sycl::device_has()]]`, the front-end adds
  an `!sycl_declared_aspects` metadata to the function's definition listing
  the aspects from that attribute.

* If a completed enum is decorated with `[[sycl_detail::sycl_type(aspect)]]` the
  front-end adds an `!sycl_aspects` metadata to the module containing one
  metadata node for each value in the enum. If there are multiple enum
  definitions with the `[[sycl_detail::sycl_type(aspect)]]` attribute a
  diagnostic is issued.


### New LLVM IR pass to propagate aspect usage

We add a new IR phase to the device compiler which does the following:

* Creates (or augments) a function's `!sycl_used_aspects` metadata with
  aspects that come from references to types in the
  `sycl_types_that_use_aspects` list.

* If a function has the `!sycl_declared_aspects` metadata, creates (or augments)
  the function's `!sycl_used_aspects` metadata with aspects from the
  `!sycl_declared_aspects` list.

* Propagates each function's `!sycl_used_aspects` metadata up the static call
  graph so that each function lists the aspects used by that function and by
  any functions it calls.

* Creates an `!sycl_fixed_targets` metadata for each kernel function or
  `SYCL_EXTERNAL` function that is defined.  This is done regardless of whether
  the `-fsycl-fixed-targets` command line switch is specified.  If the switch
  is not specified, the metadata has an empty list of targets.

Additionally, the pass will issue warning diagnostics in the following cases:

* If any function that has `!sycl_declared_aspects` uses an aspect not listed in
  that declared set.

* If the `-fsycl-fixed-targets` command line switch is specified and any
  function uses an aspect that is not compatible with all target devices
  specified by that switch.

It is important that this IR phase runs before any other optimization phase
that might eliminate a reference to a type or inline a function call because
such optimizations will cause us to miss information about aspects that are
used.  Therefore, it is recommended that this new phase run first, before all
other IR phases.

Implementing the first bullet point is straightforward.  The implementation can
scan the IR for each function looking for instructions that reference a type.
It can then see if that type is in the `!sycl_types_that_use_aspects` set; if
so it adds the type's aspects to the function's `!sycl_used_aspects` set.
While doing this, the implementation must have a special case for the `double`
type because the front-end does not include that type in the
`!sycl_types_that_use_aspects` set.  If a function references the `double`
type, the implementation implicitly assumes that the function uses
`aspect::fp64` and adds that aspect to the function's `!sycl_used_aspects`
set. If `!sycl_used_aspects` is attached to instruction then it is also added
to the function's `!sycl_used_aspects` set.

**NOTE**: This scan of the IR will require comparing the type referenced by
each IR instruction with the names of the types in the
`!sycl_types_that_use_aspects` metadata.  It would be very inefficient if we
did a string comparison each time.  As an optimization, the implementation can
first lookup up each type name in the `!sycl_types_that_use_aspects` metadata
set, finding the "type pointer" that corresponds to each type name.  Then the
pass over the IR can compare the type pointer in each IR instruction with the
type pointers from the `!sycl_types_that_use_aspects` metadata set.

The second bullet point requires building the static call graph, but the
implementation need not scan the instructions in each function.  Instead, it
need only look at the `!sycl_used_aspects` metadata for each function,
propagating the aspects used by each function up to it callers and augmenting
the caller's `!sycl_used_aspects` set.

Diagnosing warnings for the fifth bullet point is then straightforward.  The
implementation looks for functions that have `!sycl_declared_aspects` and
compares that set with the `!sycl_used_aspects` set (if any).  If a function
uses an aspect that is not in the declared set, the implementation issues a
warning.

Diagnosing warnings for the sixth bullet point requires the [device
configuration file][7] which gives the set of allowed optional features for
each target device.  The implementation looks for functions that have either
`!sycl_declared_aspects` or `!sycl_used_aspects`, and it compares the aspects
from these metadata to the allowed list in the configuration file.  If any
aspect is not on the allowed list, the implementation issues a warning.  In
addition, the implementation looks for device functions that have
`!intel_reqd_sub_group_size` or `!reqd_work_group_size`.  If the required
sub-group size or the required work-group size is not allowed for the target
devices according to the configuration file, the implementation issues a
warning.

[7]: <#device-configuration-file>

One weakness of this design is that the warning message will only be able to
contain the source location of the problem if the compiler was invoked with
`-g` because this is the only time when the front-end propagates source
location information into the IR.  To compensate, the warning message displays
the static call chain that leads to the problem.  For example:

```
warning: function 'foo' uses aspect 'fp64' not listed in 'sycl::device_has'
use is from this call chain:
  foo()
  bar()
  boo()
compile with '-g' to get source location
```

Including the call chain in the warning message will require maintaining some
additional information during the traversal of the static call graph described
above.

When the compiler is invoked with `-g`, the implementation uses the
`!DILocation` metadata to improve the warning message with source file, line,
and column information like so:

```
hw.cpp:27:4: warning: function 'foo' uses aspect 'fp64' not listed in 'sycl::device_has'
use is from this call chain:
  foo()
  bar() hw.cpp:15:3
  boo() hw.cpp:25:5
```

In the example above, the location `hw.cpp:27:4` gives the source location of
the code that uses the `fp64` aspect, in this case somewhere in the `boo()`
function.  The location `hw.cpp:15:3` tells the location in `foo()` of the call
to `bar()`, etc.

**NOTE**: Issuing this warning message from an IR pass is a compromise.  We
would get better source location if the front-end diagnosed this warning.
However, we feel that the analysis required to diagnose this warning would be
too expensive in the front-end because it requires an additional pass over the
AST.  By contrast, we can diagnose the warning more efficiently in an IR pass
because traversal of the IR is much more efficient than traversal of the AST.
The downside, though, is that the warning message is less informative.

#### Pre- and post-optimization aspect propagation

Sometimes aspects that are used by a kernel in source code are eliminated during
optimization. The most common case is when a kernel uses a double precision
floating point literal to initialize a single precision floating point variable.
Although the kernel uses the aspect `fp64` (corresponding to `double`) in its
source code, the optimizer commonly replaces the double precision literal with a
single precision literal, and this can sometimes mean that the kernel does not
actually rely on the `fp64` aspect at all. We therefore have a quandary, should
kernels like this be allowed to run on a device that doesn't have `fp64`
support?

It seems too extreme to raise an exception if the application attempts to submit
a kernel like this to a device without fp64 support because applications like
this previously ran without error (prior to this design being implemented).
However, it also seems useful to issue a warning in a case like this if the
application specifically decorated the kernel with `[[sycl::device_has()]]`
(i.e. requesting a warning if the kernel uses aspects not listed in that
attribute). We therefore run the aspect propagation pass twice: once before
optimization and again after optimization.

The first run of the pass takes a list of aspect names to exclude when saving
the result of the propagation. It will still propagate the excluded aspects to
correctly issue strict warning diagnostics for the cases mentioned above, but
after the pass finishes functions will only have the excluded aspects in their
`!sycl_used_aspects` metadata if they had them prior to the execution of the
pass.

In the second run of the pass, all aspects are propagated and saved. For the
aspects that were not excluded from the first run of the pass this will have no
effect and the pass may elect to ignore these aspects. To avoid repeating
warnings issued by the previous execution of the pass, this run will not issue
any warning diagnostics.

### Assumptions on other phases of clang

The post-link tool (described below) uses the `!sycl_used_aspects` and
`!sycl_declared_aspects` metadata, so this metadata must be retained by any
other clang passes.  However, post-link only uses this metadata when it
decorates the definition of a kernel function or the definition of an exported
device function, so it does not matter if intervening clang passes discard the
metadata on other device functions.

We think this is a safe assumption for two reasons.  First, the existing design
must already preserve the `!reqd_work_group_size` metadata that decorates
kernel functions.  Second, the kernel functions and exported device functions
always have external linkage, so there is no possibility that a clang phase
will optimize them away.

**NOTE**: Ideally, we would change the llvm-link tool to somehow preserve the
`!sycl_declared_aspects` and `!sycl_used_aspects` metadata for functions
marked `SYCL_EXTERNAL` so that we could compare the declared aspects (in the
module that imports the function) with the used aspects (in the module the
exports the function).  This would allow us to diagnose errors where the
importing translation unit's declared aspects do not match the aspects actually
used by the function.

We do not propose this change as part of this design, though.  We expect that
this will not be a common error because applications can avoid this problem by
declaring the `SYCL_EXTERNAL` function in a common header that is included by
both the importing and the exporting translation unit.  If the declaration (in
the header) is decorated with `[[sycl::device_has()]]`, the shared declaration
will ensure that the definition stays in sync with the declaration.


### Changes to the post-link tool

As noted in the requirements section above, DPC++ currently bundles kernels
together regardless of the optional features they use, and this can lead to
problems resulting from speculative compilation.  To illustrate, consider
kernel *K1* that uses no optional features and kernel *K2* that uses a feature
corresponding to aspect *A*, and consider the case when *K1* and *K2* are
bundled together in the same device image.  Now consider an application that
submits *K1* to a device that does not have aspect *A*.  The application should
expect this to work, but DPC++ currently fails because JIT-compiling *K1*
causes the entire bundle to be compiled, and this fails when trying to compile
*K2* for a device that does not have aspect *A*.

We solve this problem by changing the post-link tool to bundle kernels and
exported device functions according to the aspects that they use.

#### Changes to the device code split algorithm

The algorithm for splitting device functions into images must be changed to
account for the aspects used by each kernel or exported device function.  The
goal is to ensure that two kernels or exported device functions are only
bundled together into the same device image if they use exactly the same set
of aspects.

For the purposes of this analysis, the set of *UsedAspects* aspects is computed
by taking the union of the aspects listed in the kernel's (or device
function's) `!sycl_used_aspects` and `!sycl_declared_aspects` sets.  This is
consistent with the SYCL specification, which says that a kernel decorated with
`[[sycl::device_has()]]` may only be submitted to a device that provides the
listed aspects, regardless of whether the kernel actually uses those aspects.

We must also split two kernels into different device images if they have
different `[[sycl::reqd_sub_group_size()]]` or different
`[[sycl::reqd_work_group_size()]]` values.  The reasoning is similar as the
aspect case.  The JIT compiler currently raises an error if it tries to compile
a kernel that has a required sub-group size if the size isn't supported by the
target device.  The behavior for required work-group size is less clear.  The
Intel implementation does not raise a JIT compilation error when compiling a
kernel that uses an unsupported work-group size, but other backends might.
Therefore, it seems safest to split device code based required work-group size
also.

The algorithm is different, though, for translation units that were compiled
with `-fsycl-fixed-targets`.  Since the user has asserted that device code in
these translation units will be run *only* on the targets listed in that
switch, we know that all such device code can be bundled together in the same
device image so long as the translation units were compiled with the same
`-fsycl-fixed-targets` switch.

Therefore, two kernels or exported device functions can only be bundled
together into the same device image if:

* They both have `!sycl_fixed_targets` metadata with the same non-empty set of
  targets, or

* All of the following are true:
  - Both have an empty set of `!sycl_fixed_targets` metadata,
  - They share the same set of *UsedAspects* aspects,
  - They either both have no required work-group size or both have the same
    required work-group size, and
  - They either both have the same numeric value for their required sub-group
    size or neither has a numeric value for a required sub-group size.  (Note
    that this implies that kernels decorated with
    `[[intel::named_sub_group_size(automatic)]]` can be bundled together with
    kernels that are decorated with `[[intel::named_sub_group_size(primary)]]`
    and that either of these kernels could be bundled with a kernel that has no
    required sub-group size.)

These criteria are an additional filter applied to the device code split
algorithm after taking into account the `-fsycl-device-code-split` command line
option.  If the user requests `per_kernel` device code split, then each kernel
is already in its own device image, so no further splitting is required.  If
the user requests any other option, device code is first split according to
that option, and then another split is performed to ensure that each device
image contains only kernels or exported device functions that meet the criteria
listed above.

#### Error checking for SYCL\_EXTERNAL functions

After bundling the device functions into images, the `sycl-post-link` tool does
another pass over the IR of each image to catch errors that occur with
`SYCL_EXTERNAL` functions:

* It's possible that a translation unit calling a `SYCL_EXTERNAL` function did
  not properly decorate the function's declaration with the set of aspects that
  it uses.  Such an error would not be caught in earlier phases, which operate
  on a single translation unit at a time.

* It's possible that a translation unit calling a `SYCL_EXTERNAL` function was
  compiled with `-fsycl-fixed-targets`, but the translation unit defining the
  `SYCL_EXTERNAL` function was not compiled with this option (or was compiled
  to assume a different set of target devices).

If the image contains kernels that were *not* compiled with
`-fsycl-fixed-targets`, the pass works as follows:

* Set *FinalUsedAspects* to the image's *UsedAspects* set of aspects (which
  could be the empty set if the image has no required aspects).
* Set *FinalSubGroup* to the image's required sub-group size (which could be
  the empty set if the image has no required sub-group size).
* Set *FinalWorkGroup* to the image's required work-group size (which could be
  the empty set if the image has no required work-group size).
* Scan over all functions in the image and examine the function's metadata:
  - If the function has either `!sycl_used_aspects` or
    `!sycl_declared_aspects` metadata and one of the aspects in that metadata
    is not in the image's *UsedAspects* set, issue a warning and add that
    aspect to the *FinalUsedAspects* set.
  - If the function has `!intel_reqd_sub_group_size` metadata and the size is
    not the same as the image's required sub-group size, issue a warning and
    add that sub-group size to the *FinalSubGroup* set.
  - (Since the `[[sycl::reqd_work_group_size()]]` attribute cannot be specified
    on a `SYCL_EXTERNAL` function, there is no need for a similar check on the
    required work-group size.)
* Set the following properties in the "SYCL/device requirements" property set
  (described below):
  - If *FinalUsedAspects* is not the empty set, create an "aspect" property
    with those values.
  - If *FinalSubGroup* is not the empty set, create a "reqd\_sub\_group\_size"
    property with those values.
  - If *FinalWorkGroup* is not the empty set, create a
    "reqd\_work\_group\_size" property with those values.

Warning messages from this pass look like:

```
warning: function 'foo' uses aspect 'fp64' not expected by its calling kernel.
Missing [[sycl::device_has()]] on SYCL_EXTERNAL function?

warning: function 'bar' has required sub-group size '32' that does not match
its calling kernel.  Missing [[sycl::reqd_sub_group()]] attribute on
SYCL_EXTERNAL function?
```

If the image contains kernels that *were* compiled with `-fsycl-fixed-targets`,
the pass works as follows:

* Set *FinalFixedTargets* to the image's set of fixed target devices.
* Scan over all functions in the image looking for functions that have the
  `!sycl_fixed_targets` metadata.  If the metadata exists and its set includes
  any target devices not in the image's set of fixed targets, issue a warning
  and set *FinalFixedTargets* to the intersection of the metadata's target set
  and the *FinalFixedTargets* set.  (This may result in *FinalFixedTargets*
  being the empty set.)
* Set the following properties in the "SYCL/device requirements" property set:
  - Create a "fixed\_target" property (even if *FinalFixedTargets* is the empty
    set).  This requires converting each target name in *FinalFixedTargets* to
    its associated aspect.

Warning messages from this pass look like:

```
warning: function 'foo' compiled with a different `-fsycl-fixed-targets` switch
than its calling kernel.
```

#### Create the "SYCL/device requirements" property set

The DPC++ runtime needs some way to know about the requirements of an image
(e.g. the set of aspects that it uses).  Therefore, the `sycl-post-link` tool
provides this information in a new property set named
"SYCL/device requirements".

The following table lists the properties that this set may contain and their
types:

Property Name             | Property Type
-------------             | -------------
"aspect"                  | `SYCL_PROPERTY_TYPE_BYTE_ARRAY`
"reqd\_sub\_group\_size"  | `SYCL_PROPERTY_TYPE_BYTE_ARRAY`
"reqd\_work\_group\_size" | `SYCL_PROPERTY_TYPE_BYTE_ARRAY`
"fixed\_target"           | `SYCL_PROPERTY_TYPE_BYTE_ARRAY`

The "aspect" property tells the set of aspects that a device must have in order
to use the image.  The image is only compatible with a device that supports
**all** of the listed aspects.  The value of the property is an array of
`uint32` values, where each `uint32` value is the numerical value of an aspect
from `enum class aspect`.  The size of the property (which is always divisible
by `4`) tells the number of aspects in the array.

The "reqd\_sub\_group\_size" property tells the set of numeric sub-group sizes
that a device must support in order to use the image.  (This does not include
named sub-group sizes like `automatic` or `primary`.)  The image is only
compatible with a device that supports **all** of the listed sizes.  The value
of the property is an array of `uint32` values, where each `uint32` value tells
a required sub-group size.  The size of the property (which is always divisible
by `4`) tells the number of entries in the array.

The "reqd\_work\_group\_size" property tells the set of work-group sizes that a
device must support in order to use the image.  The image is only compatible
with a device that supports **all** of the listed sizes.  The value of the
property is a `BYTE_ARRAY` with entries that have the following layout:

```
<dim_count (uint32)> <dim0 (uint32)> ...
```

Where `dim_count` is the number of work group dimensions (i.e. 1, 2, or 3), and
`dim0 ...` are the values of the dimensions from the
`[[reqd_work_group_size()]]` attribute, in the same order as they appear in the
attribute.  The size of the property tells the number of entries in the array.

The "fixed\_target" property indicates that the image was compiled with
`-fsycl-fixed-targets`, and it is assumed to be runnable only on the set of
target devices that are listed in this property.  The value of the property is
an array of `uint32` values where each `uint32` value is the numerical value of
an aspect from `enum class aspect`, telling one of the target devices from the
command line switch.  (Each target device has a corresponding aspect.)  The
size of the property (which is always divisible by `4`) tells the number of
aspects in the array.


### Changes specific to AOT mode

Additional changes are required that are specific to the AOT compilation mode.
The problem is that the tools we use to perform the AOT compilation (e.g.
`ocloc` or `opencl-aot`) fail if the input SPIR-V module uses features that
are incompatible with the target device.  Therefore, we must avoid calling
these tools for SPIR-V modules that contain features that are incompatible
with the device for which we are compiling.

#### New target names

The first step of the solution allows the compiler to know which devices are
the AOT targets.  Currently, the compiler does not know this because the target
device names are passed directly to the underlying tool (e.g. `ocloc`).  For
example, a typical AOT compilation for an Intel GPU device currently looks like
this:

```
$ clang++ -fsycl -fsycl-targets=spir64_gen -Xs "-device pvc,dg1" ...
```

Here, the user requests AOT compilation for Intel GPU devices via
`-fsycl-targets=spir64_gen` and specifies the actual device names through
`-Xs "-device pvc,dg1"`.  The `-device pvc,dg1` option, however, is passed
verbatim to the `ocloc` tool without being parsed by the DPC++ compiler
driver.  As a result, DPC++ doesn't know the specific target devices.

To solve this, we expand the legal target names that are accepted by the
`-fsycl-targets` command line option.  The exact target names are defined in
a configuration file (described next), but the previous example now looks like
this:

```
$ clang++ -fsycl -fsycl-targets=intel_gpu_pvc,intel_gpu_dg1 ...
```

DPC++ now knows the exact devices that are the target of the AOT compilation
because the compiler driver does parse the `-fsycl-targets` option.  The new
syntax is also easier for users because they specify the target names through
a single switch rather than a combination of `-fsycl-targets` and
`-Xs "-device"`.

#### Device configuration file

DPC++ also needs to know the set of optional features that are supported by
each AOT target device.  For example, we need to know the set of aspects and
sub-group sizes that each device supports.  This information is provided by
a configuration file, which has its own [specification][8].  As noted above,
the configuration file contains the target names that are accepted by the
compiler driver as parameters to the `-fsycl-targets` option.  It also
contains a list of the aspects, sub-group sizes, and other features that
are supported by each target.

There is also a way for the user to define their own configuration file, which
allows users to compile for devices that have not yet been released to the
public.

[8]: <DeviceConfigFile.md>

#### Expanded command line options to the post link tool

The `sycl-post-link` tool will be responsible for generating different output
for each target device (described next).  In order to do this, the compiler
driver needs to pass separate `-o` options for each target device.  Currently,
the `sycl-post-link` tool is invoked like this:

```
$ sycl-post-link [other options] -o=output.table input.bc
```

The input file (e.g. "input.bc") contains the LLVM IR input.  The `-o` option
provides the name of the output "file table" (e.g. "output.table") that the
`sycl-post-link` tool generates.

As detailed below, we want to generate a separate output file table for each
compilation target, so the driver needs to invoke `sycl-post-link` with several
`-o` options like this:

```
$ sycl-post-link [other options] -o=output-spirv.table \
  -o=intel_gpu_pvc,output-pvc.table -o=intel_gpu_dg1,output-dg1.table input.bc
```

Unless the user requested to omit SPIR-V from the final executable, the driver
passes a `-o` option with no device name as shown above
(`-o=output-spirv.table`).  The driver also passes a `-o` option with a device
name for each target in the `-fsycl-targets` list (e.g.
`-o=intel_gpu_pvc,output-pvc.table`).

#### New filtering pass in the post link tool

When `sycl-post-link` sees one of the new `-o` options with the device name, it
performs a final filtering pass on the IR modules it generates.  To understand
this filtering, consider the content of the generated file table:

```
[Code|Properties|Symbols]
mod1.bc|mod1.prop|mod1.sym
mod2.bc|mod2.prop|mod2.sym
mod3.bc|mod3.prop|mod3.sym
```

After the header line, there is one line for each IR module that the
`sycl-post-link` tool generates.

To implement the final filtering pass, the `sycl-post-link` tool uses the
configuration file to determine the features (e.g. aspects or sub-group sizes)
that are supported by a target device.  If any IR module uses an incompatible
feature, the corresponding row in the table is changed to use an empty IR
module instead.  To illustrate, let's assume that
`-o=intel_gpu_pvc,output-pvc.table` is passed and that module "mod2.bc" uses
features that are incompatible with PVC.  The generated table file
"output-pvc.table" would look like this:

```
[Code|Properties|Symbols]
mod1.bc|mod1.prop|mod1.sym
empty.bc|mod2.prop|mod2.sym
mod3.bc|mod3.prop|mod3.sym
```

Notice how the incompatible IR module "mod2.bc" has been replaced with an empty
IR module "empty.bc".  The other entries on this row ("mod2.prop" and
"mod2.sym") are unchanged.  It's important to preserve the original properties,
so that the runtime can diagnose an error if the application mistakenly tries
to submit a kernel from this IR module to a device that does not support the
features it uses.

#### AOT compilation and offload wrapping

Currently, the compiler driver invokes the AOT compilation tool (e.g. `ocloc`
or `opencl-aot`) once for each IR module in the table file that is generated
by `sycl-post-link`.  When AOT compiling for multiple devices, the driver
invokes the tool once, passing several target names (e.g.
`ocloc -device pvc,dg1`).

With the new design, the driver invokes the AOT compilation tool once for each
IR module in each of the generated file tables.  Each invocation of the tool
compiles for just a single target device.  To illustrate, let's assume DPC++
was invoked with `-fsycl-targets=intel_gpu_pvc,intel_gpu_dg1`.  In this case,
`sycl-post-link` generates two file tables: one for PVC and one for DG1.  The
driver invokes `ocloc -device pvc` once for each IR module in the PVC file
table, and it invokes `ocloc -device dg1` once for each IR module in the DG1
file table.

The driver also passes `-exclude_ir` to `ocloc` in order to prevent it from
embedding a redundant IR module in each of the ocloc output files.  These
backup IR modules are unnecessary because DPC++ stores a SPIR-V module in the
host executable (unless the user specifically requested not to generate
SPIR-V).

The driver also invokes `clang-offload-wrapper` to wrap the native offload
modules for inclusion in the host executable.  Currently, the driver passes
`-target=spir64` when not doing AOT compilation (i.e. when generating SPIR-V
for the target code), and it passes `-target=spir64_gen` when doing AOT
compilation.  The target name `spir64_gen` indicates that the offload bundle
is native code that can run on any Intel GPU.

With the new design, the driver still uses `-target=spir64` to identify a
SPIR-V offload bundle, however it must use a more specific device name for
native offload bundles.  We use the same target names accepted by
`-fsycl-targets`.  For example, if DPC++ is invoked with
`-fsycl-targets=intel_gpu_pvc,intel_gpu_dg1`, then the driver invokes
`clang-offload-wrapper` twice, once with `-target=intel_gpu_pvc` and once with
`-target=intel_gpu_dg1`.

As noted earlier, the user may specify a custom configuration file to compile
for an Intel GPU device that has not yet been publicly released.  When this
happens, the configuration file causes the driver to pass
`clang-offload-wrapper` an option of the form `-target=intel_gpu_XXX` where the
"XXX" represents the Intel GMDID of the device.

**TODO**: We are considering moving away from the `-fsycl-targets` option and
using the clang option `--offload-arch` instead.  If we do this, the target
device names might change too in order to align with the naming style used by
other offload architectures.  I presume we want to use the same strings for
both `--offload-arch` and for the `-target` option to `clang-offload-wrapper`.
Therefore, the target names presented above might change.

**TODO**: The handling of the SPIR-V offload bundle requires some more thought.
In the current design, there are two different types of SPIR-V modules, which
are not exactly the same.

If the user compiles with `-fsycl-targets=spir64` (which is the default), the
device compiler is invoked with `-triple spir64-unknown-unknown`, and the
generated IR is converted to SPIR-V.  This type of SPIR-V module is wrapped
into the host executable via `clang-offload-wrapper -target=spir64` (i.e. the
offload bundle has type "spir64").

However, if the user AOT compiles for an Intel GPU with
`-fsycl-targets=spir64_gen`, the device compiler is invoked with
`-triple spir64_gen-unknown-unknown`, which is a different triple from the case
above.  This IR is also converted to SPIR-V and then sent to the `ocloc` tool.
The `ocloc` tool compiles the SPIR-V to native code but also embeds the SPIR-V
into the ocloc output.  This SPIR-V is used by the device driver if the
application is run on a GPU device that does not match any of the AOT targets.

In the new design, `ocloc` does not embed SPIR-V in its output because we
invoke it with `-exclude_ir`.  Instead, DPC++ is responsible for embedding the
SPIR-V in the host executable, but should that SPIR-V be generated with the
triple `spir64-unknown-unknown` or the triple `spir64_gen-unknown-unknown`?
We could generate both, but that seems wasteful.  If we generate the SPIR-V
with `spir64-unknown-unknown`, does that mean we need to run the device
compiler twice, once with `spir64_gen-unknown-unknown` (to generate SPIR-V that
is fed to `ocloc`) and once with `spir64-unknown-unknown` (to generate SPIR-V
that is embedded in the host executable)?  This also seems wasteful because
it requires running the device compiler twice whenever the user AOT compiles
for an Intel GPU.

An ideal solution would be to always generate SPIR-V using the triple
`spir64-unknown-unknown`, and use this SPIR-V as input to both `ocloc` and
`opencl-aot`.  This would allow us to run the device compiler just once even if
the user AOT compiles for both Intel GPU and CPU.  However, this means that the
SPIR-V is generated using a different triple than we use today.  It's unclear
what ramification this has.


### Changes to the DPC++ runtime

#### Identifying a compatible offload bundle

Since the user may AOT compile for several different offload targets, the
runtime must determine which offload bundles are compatible with the queue's
device.  If the device is an Intel GPU, the runtime uses either
[`ze_device_ip_version_ext_t`][9] (on Level Zero) or
[`CL_DEVICE_IP_VERSION_INTEL`][10] (on OpenCL) to get the GMDID of the
device.  This GMDID value can be mapped to any of the Intel GPU target names
that are used for AOT compiled offload bundles.

If the runtime doesn't find an AOT compiled offload bundle, it searches for a
SPIR-V bundle using the offload target name "spir64".

[9]: <https://spec.oneapi.io/level-zero/latest/core/api.html#ze-device-ip-version-ext-t>
[10]: <https://registry.khronos.org/OpenCL/extensions/intel/cl_intel_device_attribute_query.html>

#### Raising an exception when features are incompatible

The runtime must also check to see if a kernel uses any optional features that
the device does not support.  If this happens, the runtime must raise a
synchronous `errc::kernel_not_supported` exception.

After the runtime finds the correct offload bundle as described above, it finds
the device image in that offload bundle which defines the kernel.  If
[Device Code Dynamic Linking][4] is supported, the runtime also identifies all
the other device images that export device functions which are needed by the
kernel as described in that design document.  Before the runtime links these
images together, it compares each image's "SYCL/device requirements" against
the features provided by the target device.  If any of the following checks
fail, the runtime throws `errc::kernel_not_supported`:

* The "fixed\_target" property exists, and the device is not one of the target
  devices listed in the property, or
* The "aspect" property contains an aspect that is not provided by the device,
  or
* The "reqd\_sub\_group\_size" property contains a sub-group size that the
  device does not support, or
* The "reqd\_work\_group\_size" property contains a work-group size that the
  device does not support.  Currently, the only portable check that will work
  for all devices is to verify that the total number of work items in the
  "reqd\_work\_group\_size" property is no greater than the device's value for
  `info::device::max_work_group_size`.  However, individual backends may
  provide other checks.

If the runtime throws an exception, it happens even before the runtime tries to
access the contents of the device image.

The exception's `what` string contains a message describing the reason the
device image is incompatible.  For example:

```
Kernel was compiled with '-fsycl-fixed-targets=intel_gpu_12_0_0' but was
submitted to a different device.

Kernel uses optional feature corresponding to 'aspect::fp16' but device does
not support this aspect.

Kernel has a required sub-group size of '32' but device does not support this
sub-group size.
```

### SYCL internal aspects for device image splitting

There are scenarios when we would like to split device images based on
optional kernel features but we don't want to expose corresponding
aspects to the user. Internal SYCL aspects are used for this purpose.

To differentiate them from regular aspects, internal aspects are assigned
negative values. If optional feature is used in the kernel then SYCL
device compiler adds value of internal aspect to 'sycl_used_aspects' metadata,
it gets propagated through the call graph and participates in device image
splitting together with regular aspects but it's not passed to the SYCL runtime,
it is filtered out when generating a set of device requirements.

New value can be added to 'SYCLInternalAspect' enum to introduce new internal
aspect.

Example of internal aspects usage is splitting device images based on floating
point accuracy level for math functions provided by user using -ffp-accuracy option.

## Appendix: Adding an attribute to 8-byte `atomic_ref`

As described above under ["Changes to DPC++ headers"][11], we need to decorate
any SYCL type representing an optional device feature with the
`[[sycl_detail::uses_aspects()]]` attribute.  This is somewhat tricky for
`atomic_ref`, though, because it is only an optional feature when specialized
for a 8-byte type.  However, we can accomplish this by using partial
specialization techniques.  The following code snippet demonstrates (best read
from bottom to top):

[11]: <#changes-to-dpc-headers>

```
namespace sycl {
namespace detail {

template<typename T>
class atomic_ref_impl_base {
 public:
  atomic_ref_impl_base(T x) : x(x) {}

  // All the member functions for atomic_ref go here

 private:
  T x;
};

// Template class which can be specialized based on the size of the underlying
// type.
template<typename T, size_t S>
class atomic_ref_impl : public atomic_ref_impl_base<T> {
 public:
  using atomic_ref_impl_base<T>::atomic_ref_impl_base;
};

// Explicit specialization for 8-byte types.  Only this specialization has the
// attribute.
template<typename T>
class [[__sycl_detail__::__uses_aspects__(aspect::atomic64)]]
    atomic_ref_impl<T, 8> : public atomic_ref_impl_base<T> {
 public:
  using atomic_ref_impl_base<T>::atomic_ref_impl_base;
};

} // namespace detail

// Publicly visible atomic_ref class.
template<typename T>
class atomic_ref : public detail::atomic_ref_impl<T, sizeof(T)> {
 public:
  atomic_ref(T x) : detail::atomic_ref_impl<T, sizeof(T)>(x) {}
};

} // namespace sycl
```

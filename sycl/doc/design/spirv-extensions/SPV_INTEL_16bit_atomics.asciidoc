== Status

* Working Draft

This is a preview extension specification, intended to provide early access to a feature for review and community feedback. When the feature matures, this specification may be released as a formal extension.

Because the interfaces defined by this specification are not final and are subject to change they are not intended to be used by shipping software products. If you are interested in using this feature in your software product, please let us know!

== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SPIR-V Specification, Version 1.6 Revision 6.

This extension requires SPIR-V 1.0.

This extension extends the *SPV_EXT_shader_atomic_float_add* and
*SPV_EXT_shader_atomic_float_min_max* extensions, which provide the
floating-point atomic operations used by this extension.

This extension depends on the *SPV_KHR_bfloat16* extension, which adds the
`bfloat16` floating-point type used by this extension.

== Overview

This extension extends the atomic support in SPIR-V to support atomic operations
on 16-bit integer in memory, and to support floating-point atomic addition,
minimum, and maximum on 16-bit `bfloat16` floating-point numbers in memory.

== Extension Name

To use this extension within a SPIR-V module, the following *OpExtension* must
be present in the module:

== Modifications to the SPIR-V Specification, Version 1.6

== Validation Rules

* For all atomic instructions, the _Result Type_ may be a 16-bit integer type,
and the type of _Value_ may be a 16-bit integer type.
** If the _Result Type_ for *OpAtomicLoad*, *OpAtomicExchange*,
*OpAtomicCompareExchange*, or *OpAtomicCompareExchangeWeak* is a 16-bit integer
type, then the *{capability_name_int16_cmpxchg}* capability must be declared.
** If the type of _Value_ for *OpAtomicStore* is a 16-bit integer type, then the
*{capability_name_int16_cmpxchg}* capability must be declared.
** For all other atomic instructions, if the _Result Type_ is a 16-bit integer
type or the type of _Value_ is a 16-bit integer type, then the
*{capability_name_int16_atomics}* capability must be declared.

* For the instructions *OpAtomicLoad*, *OpAtomicExchange*, *OpAtomicFAddEXT*,
*OpAtomicFMinEXT*, or *OpAtomicFMaxEXT*, the _Result Type_ may be a 16-bit
floating-point type with the *BFloat16KHR* encoding, and the type of _Value_ may
be a 16-bit floating-point type with the *BFloat16KHR* encoding.
** If the _Result Type_ for *OpAtomicLoad* or *OpAtomicExchange* is a 16-bit
floating-point type with the *Bfloat16KHR* encoding, then either the
*{capability_name_bf16_add}* or *{capability_name_bf16_minmax}* capabilities
must be declared. +
*TODO*: Check this!
** If the type of _Value_ for *OpAtomicStore* is a 16-bit floating-point type
with the *BFloat16KHR* encoding, then either the *{capability_name_bf16_add}* or
*{capability_name_bf16_minmax}* capabilities must be declared. +
*TODO*: Check this!
** If the _Result Type_ for *OpAtomicFAddEXT* is a 16-bit floating-point type
with the *BFloat16KHR* encoding, then the *{capability_name_bf16_add}* capability
must be declared.
** If the _Result Type_ for *OpAtomicFMinEXT* or *OpAtomicFMaxEXT* is a 16-bit
floating-point type with the *BFloat16KHR* encoding, then the
*{capability_name_bf16_minmax}* capability must be declared.

== Issues

. Do we need to support the case where `bfloat16` values are represented as
16-bit integers where the bit pattern represents a `bfloat16` value?
+
--
*RESOLVED*: No, we will only support the case with a real `bfloat16` type,
specifically a 16-bit floating-point type with the *BFloat16KHR* encoding. This
means that this extension has a dependency on *SPV_KHR_bfloat16*.

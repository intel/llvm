* Working Draft

This is a preview extension specification, intended to provide early access to
a feature for review and community feedback. When the feature matures, this
specification may be released as a formal extension.

Because the interfaces defined by this specification are not final and are
subject to change they are not intended to be used by shipping software
products. If you are interested in using this feature in your software product,
please let us know!

4+|[[OpClampConvertFToFINTEL]]*OpClampConvertFToFINTEL* +
 +
Converts numerically one floating point value to another.
In case of overflow, the positive result clamps to maximum normal value.
The negative result clamps to lowest negative normal value, which is equal to
maximum normal value multiplied by -1. +
 +
_Result Type_ is the type of the converted object, it must be a scalar or
vector of _float type_. +
 +
_Value_ must be a scalar or vector of _float type_. It must have a wider range
than the _Result Type_ and it must have the same number of components as 'Result Type'. +
 +
Results are computed per component. +

4+|[[OpClampConvertFToSINTEL]]*OpClampConvertFToSINTEL* +
 +
Converts numerically a floating point value to integer.
In case of overflow, the result is saturated to INT_MAX or INT_MIN depending on a sign bit. +
 +
_Result Type_ is the type of the converted object, it must be a scalar or
vector of _integer type_. +
 +
_Value_ must be a scalar or vector of _float type_.
It must have the same number of components as 'Result Type'. +

[cols="1a,1,5*",width="100%"]
|=====
6+|[[OpStochasticRoundFToFINTEL]]*OpStochasticRoundFToFINTEL* +
 +
Converts numerically one floating point value to another using stochastic rounding.
 +
Stochastic rounding is performed by adding a pseudo-random bias value to the mantissa
of the converted value as follows. The bias is first added to the mantissa of the converted value.
If this causes the mantissa to overflow, then the exponent of the converted value
is increased by 1 and the mantissa bits are shifted right. The value is then converted
to the _Result Type_, rounding towards zero. If the exponent overflows when converting
to the _Result Type_, the result of the conversion is +/- Inf. If _Result Type_ doesn't have
Inf representation, then in case of overflow the result saturates to max normal value representable
by the type preserving the sign. +
 +
As described above, each input requires a bias value in order to perform the conversion.
These bias values are generated by executing an implementation-defined algorithm
that produces pseudo-random values that uses _Seed_ as a starting point. This algorithm is
guaranteed to produce repeatable bias values when the same value is passed for _Seed_. +
 +
The instruction also returns a value in _Next Seed_, which client code can use to generate
good quality random biases. If the client intends to call *OpStochasticRoundFToFINTEL*
again from the same kernel invocation, it should use this value as a new seed that it
passes as _Seed_ in that next call. +
 +
_Result Type_ is the type of the converted object, it must be a scalar or
vector of _float type_. +
 +
_Value_ must be a scalar or vector of _float type_. It must have a wider range
than the _Result Type_ and it must have the same number of components as 'Result Type'. +
 +
_Seed_ must be a 32-bit scalar _integer type_. +
 +
_Next Seed_ must be of a _pointer type_ with *Function* storage class and 32-bit scalar _integer_ element type. +
 +
Results are computed per component. +

Validation Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add the following bullets to section 2.16.11, Universal Validation Rules:

  * Variables with a type that is or includes a floating-point type with the *BFloat16KHR*, *Float8E4M3EXT*, *Float8E5M2EXT* and *Float4E2M1INTEL* encodings can also be used with the following instructions:
  ** *OpClampConvertFToFINTEL*

  * Variables with a type that is or includes a floating-point type with the *BFloat16KHR*, *Float8E4M3EXT*, *Float8E5M2EXT* and *Float4E2M1INTEL* encodings can also be used with the following instructions:
  ** *OpStochasticRoundFToFINTEL*
  ** *OpClampStochasticRoundFToFINTEL*

  * Variables with a type that is or includes a floating-point type with the *BFloat16KHR* encoding can also be used with the following instructions:
  ** *OpClampConvertFToSINTEL* and *OpClampStochasticRoundFToSINTEL*


== Interactions with SPV_KHR_cooperative_matrix

When *CooperativeMatrixKHR* capability is declared it is allowed to convert a _cooperative matrix_
using the instructions added by this extensions. +
If _Value_ is _cooperative matrix_, then the _Result Type_ must be a _cooperative matrix type_
with the same _Rows_, _Columns_, _Scope_ and _Use_ operands. _Seed_ operand can be non-uniform, all
other operands to these instructions must be dynamically
uniform within every instance of the _Scope_ of the _cooperative matrix_. +

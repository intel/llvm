# Environment Variables

This document describes environment variables that are having effect on DPC++
compiler and runtime.

## Controlling DPC++ runtime

| Environment variable | Values | Description |
| -------------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR` | [See below.](#oneapi_device_selector)  | This device selection environment variable can be used to limit the choice of devices available when the SYCL-using application is run.  Useful for limiting devices to a certain type (like GPUs or accelerators) or backends (like Level Zero or OpenCL).  This device selection mechanism is replacing `SYCL_DEVICE_FILTER` .  The `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR` syntax is shared with OpenMP and also allows sub-devices to be chosen. [See below.](#oneapi_device_selector) for a full description.   |
| `SYCL_DEVICE_FILTER` (deprecated) | `backend:device_type:device_num` | Please use `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR` environment variable instead. See section [`SYCL_DEVICE_FILTER`](#sycl_device_filter) below for `SYCL_DEVICE_FILTER` description. |
| `SYCL_DEVICE_ALLOWLIST` | See [below](#sycl_device_allowlist) | Filter out devices that do not match the pattern specified. `BackendName` accepts `host`, `opencl`, `level_zero`, `native_cpu` or `cuda`. `DeviceType` accepts `host`, `cpu`, `gpu` or `acc`. `DeviceVendorId` accepts uint32_t in hex form (`0xXYZW`). `DriverVersion`, `PlatformVersion`, `DeviceName` and `PlatformName` accept regular expression. Special characters, such as parenthesis, must be escaped. DPC++ runtime will select only those devices which satisfy provided values above and regex. More than one device can be specified using the piping symbol "\|".|
| `SYCL_DISABLE_PARALLEL_FOR_RANGE_ROUNDING` | Any(\*) | Disables automatic rounding-up of `parallel_for` invocation ranges. |
| `SYCL_CACHE_DIR` | Path | Path to persistent cache root directory. Default values are `%AppData%\libsycl_cache` for Windows and `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/libsycl_cache` on Linux, if `XDG_CACHE_HOME` is not set then `$HOME/.cache/libsycl_cache`. When none of the environment variables are set SYCL persistent cache is disabled. |
| `SYCL_CACHE_DISABLE_PERSISTENT (deprecated)` | Any(\*) | Has no effect. |
| `SYCL_CACHE_PERSISTENT` | Integer | Controls persistent device compiled code cache. Turns it on if set to '1' and turns it off if set to '0'. When cache is enabled SYCL runtime will try to cache and reuse JIT-compiled binaries. Default is off. |
| `SYCL_CACHE_IN_MEM` | '1' or '0' | Enable ('1') or disable ('0') in-memory caching of device compiled code. When cache is enabled SYCL runtime will try to cache and reuse JIT-compiled binaries. Default is '1'. |
| `SYCL_CACHE_EVICTION_DISABLE` | Any(\*) | Switches cache eviction off when the variable is set. |
| `SYCL_CACHE_MAX_SIZE` | Positive integer | Cache eviction is triggered once total size of cached images exceeds the value in megabytes (default - 8 192 for 8 GB). Set to 0 to disable size-based cache eviction. |
| `SYCL_CACHE_THRESHOLD` | Positive integer | Cache eviction threshold in days (default value is 7 for 1 week). Set to 0 for disabling time-based cache eviction. |
| `SYCL_CACHE_MIN_DEVICE_IMAGE_SIZE` | Positive integer | Minimum size of device code image in bytes which is reasonable to cache on disk because disk access operation may take more time than do JIT compilation for it. Default value is 0 to cache all images. |
| `SYCL_CACHE_MAX_DEVICE_IMAGE_SIZE` | Positive integer | Maximum size of device image in bytes which is cached. Too big kernels may overload disk too fast. Default value is 1 GB. |
| `SYCL_ENABLE_DEFAULT_CONTEXTS` | '1' or '0' | Enable ('1') or disable ('0') creation of default platform contexts in SYCL runtime. The default context for each platform contains all devices in the platform. Refer to [Platform Default Contexts](extensions/supported/sycl_ext_oneapi_default_context.asciidoc) extension to learn more. Enabled by default on Linux and disabled on Windows. |
| `SYCL_RT_WARNING_LEVEL` | Positive integer | The higher warning level is used the more warnings and performance hints the runtime library may print. Default value is '0', which means no warning/hint messages from the runtime library are allowed. The value '1' enables performance warnings from device runtime/codegen. The values greater than 1 are reserved for future use. |
| `SYCL_USM_HOSTPTR_IMPORT` | Integer | Enable by specifying non-zero value. Buffers created with a host pointer will result in host data promotion to USM, improving data transfer performance. To use this feature, also set SYCL_HOST_UNIFIED_MEMORY=1. |
| `SYCL_EAGER_INIT` | Integer | Enable by specifying non-zero value. Tells the SYCL runtime to do as much as possible initialization at objects construction as opposed to doing lazy initialization on the fly. This may mean doing some redundant work at warmup but ensures fastest possible execution on the following hot and reportable paths. It also instructs PI plugins to do the same. Default is "0".  |
| `SYCL_REDUCTION_PREFERRED_WORKGROUP_SIZE` | See [below](#sycl_reduction_preferred_workgroup_size) | Controls the preferred work-group size of reductions. |
| `SYCL_ENABLE_FUSION_CACHING` | '1' or '0' | Enable ('1') or disable ('0') caching of JIT compilations for kernel fusion. Caching avoids repeatedly running the JIT compilation pipeline if the same sequence of kernels is fused multiple times. Default value is '1'. |

`(*) Note: Any means this environment variable is effective when set to any non-null value.`

### `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR`

With no environment variables set to say otherwise, all platforms and devices presently on the machine are available. The default choice will be one of these devices, usually preferring a Level Zero GPU device, if available. The `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR` can be used to limit that choice of devices, and to expose GPU sub-devices or sub-sub-devices as individual devices.

The syntax of this environment variable follows this BNF grammar:
```
ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR = <selector-string>
<selector-string> ::= { <accept-filters> | <discard-filters> | <accept-filters>;<discard-filters> }
<accept-filters> ::= <accept-filter>[;<accept-filter>...]
<discard-filters> ::= <discard-filter>[;<discard-filter>...]
<accept-filter> ::= <term>
<discard-filter> ::= !<term>
<term> ::= <backend>:<devices>
<backend> ::= { * | level_zero | opencl | cuda | hip | native_cpu }  // case insensitive
<devices> ::= <device>[,<device>...]
<device> ::= { * | cpu | gpu | fpga | <num> | <num>.<num> | <num>.* | *.* | <num>.<num>.<num> | <num>.<num>.* | <num>.*.* | *.*.*  }  // case insensitive
```

Each term in the grammar selects a collection of devices from a particular backend. The device names cpu, gpu, and fpga select all devices from that backend with the corresponding type. A backend's device can also be selected by its numeric index (zero-based) or by using `*` which selects all devices in the backend.

The dot syntax (e.g. `<num>.<num>`) causes one or more GPU sub-devices to be exposed to the application as SYCL root devices. For example, `1.0` exposes the first sub-device of the second device as a SYCL root device. The syntax `<num>.*` exposes all sub-devices of the give device as SYCL root devices. The syntax `*.*` exposes all sub-devices of all GPU devices as SYCL root devices.

In general, a term with one or more asterisks ( `*` ) matches all backends, devices, or sub-devices with the given pattern. However, a warning is generated if the term does not match anything. For example, `*:gpu` matches all GPU devices in all backends (ignoring backends with no GPU devices), but it generates a warning if there are no GPU devices in any backend. Likewise, `level_zero:*.*` matches all sub-devices of partitionable GPUs in the Level Zero backend, but it generates a warning if there are no Level Zero GPU devices that are partitionable into sub-devices.

The device indices are zero-based and are unique only within a backend. Therefore, `level_zero:0` is a different device from `cuda:0`. To see the indices of all available devices, run the `sycl-ls` tool. Note that different backends sometimes expose the same hardware as different "devices". For example, the level_zero and opencl backends both expose the Intel GPU devices.


Additionally, if a sub-device is chosen (via numeric index or wildcard), then an additional layer of partitioning can be specified. In other words, a sub-sub-device can be selected. Like sub-devices, this is done with a period ( `.` ) and a sub-sub-device specifier which is a wildcard symbol ( `*` ) or a numeric index.  Example `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=level_zero:0.*.*` would partition device 0 into sub-devices and then partition each of those into sub-sub-devices. The range of grandchild sub-sub-devices would be the final devices available to the app, neither device 0, nor its child partitions would be in that list.

Lastly, a filter in the grammar can be thought of as a term in conjunction with an action that is taken on all devices that are selected by the term. The action can be an accept action or a discard action. Based on the action, a filter can be an accept filter or a discard filter.
The string `<term>` represents an accept filter and the string `!<term>` represents a discard filter. The underlying term is the same but they perform different actions on the matching devices list.
For example, `!opencl:*` discards all devices of the opencl backend from the list of available devices. The discarding filters, if there are any, must all appear at the end of the selector string.
When one or more filters accept a device and one or more filters discard the device, the latter have priority and the device is ultimately not made available to the user. This allows the user to provide selector strings such as `*:gpu;!cuda:*` that accepts all gpu devices except those with a CUDA backend.
Furthermore, if the value of this environment variable only has discarding filters, an accepting filter that matches all devices, but not sub-devices and sub-sub-devices, will be implicitly included in the
environment variable to allow the user to specify only the list of devices that must not be made available. Therefore, `!*:cpu` will accept all devices except those that are of the cpu type and `opencl:*;!*:cpu`
will accept all devices of the opencl backend except those that are of the opencl backend and of the cpu type. It is legal to have a rejection filter even if it specifies devices have already been omitted by previous filters in the selection string. Doing so has no effect; the rejected devices are still omitted.

The following examples further illustrate the usage of this environment variable:

| Example | Result |
-----------|---------
| `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=opencl:*` | Only the OpenCL devices are available |
| `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=level_zero:gpu` | Only GPU devices on the Level Zero platform are available.|
| `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR="opencl:gpu;level_zero:gpu"` | GPU devices from both Level Zero and OpenCL are available. Note that escaping (like quotation marks) will likely be needed when using semi-colon separated entries. |
| `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=opencl:gpu,cpu` | Only CPU and GPU devices on the OpenCL platform are available.|
| `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=opencl:0` | Only the device with index 0 on the OpenCL backend is available. |
| `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=hip:0,2` | Only devices with indices of 0 and 2 from the HIP backend are available. |
| `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=opencl:0.*` | All the sub-devices from the OpenCL device with index 0 are exposed as SYCL root devices. No other devices are available. |
| `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=opencl:0.2` | The third sub-device (2 in zero-based counting) of the OpenCL device with index 0 will be the sole device available.  |
| `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=level_zero:*,*.*` | Exposes Level Zero devices to the application in two different ways. Each device (aka "card") is exposed as a SYCL root device and each sub-device is also exposed as a SYCL root device.|
| `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR="opencl:*;!opencl:0"` | All OpenCL devices except for the device with index 0 are available. |
| `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR="!*:cpu"` | All devices except for CPU devices are available. |

Notes:
- The backend argument is always required. An error will be thrown if it is absent.
- Additionally, the backend MUST be followed by colon ( `:` ) and at least one device specifier of some sort, else an error is thrown.
- The sub-device and sub-sub-device syntax attempt to partition the root device
  according to the rules defined by
  `info::partition_property::partition_by_affinity_domain` and
  `info::partition_affinity_domain::next_partitionable`.
  (See the SYCL 2020 specification for a precise definition.)
  The root device is determined by the underlying backend.
- When using the Level Zero backend, see also the documentation of the
  [`ZE_FLAT_DEVICE_HIERARCHY`][ze-env] environment variable because it affects
  how this backend exposes root devices to SYCL.
  For Intel GPUs, the sub-device and sub-sub-device syntax can be used to
  expose tiles or CCSs to the SYCL application as SYCL root devices, however
  the exact mapping is determined by the `ZE_FLAT_DEVICE_HIERARCHY` environment
  variable.
- The semi-colon character ( `;` ) and the exclamation mark character ( `!`  ) are treated specially by many shells, so you may need to enclose the string in quotes if the selection string contains these characters.

### `SYCL_DEVICE_ALLOWLIST`

A list of devices and their driver version following the pattern:
`BackendName:XXX,DeviceType:YYY,DeviceVendorId:0xXYZW,DriverVersion:{{X.Y.Z.W}}`.
Also may contain `PlatformVersion`, `DeviceName` and `PlatformName`. There is no
fixed order of properties in the pattern.

### `SYCL_DEVICE_FILTER`

This environment variable limits the SYCL RT to use only a subset of the system's devices. Setting this environment variable affects all of the device query functions (`platform::get_devices()` and `platform::get_platforms()`) and all of the device selectors.

The value of this environment variable is a comma separated list of filters, where each filter is a triple of the form "`backend`:`device_type`:`device_num`" (without the quotes). Each element of the triple is optional, but each filter must have at least one value. Possible values of `backend` are:
- `host` (Deprecated)
- `level_zero`
- `opencl`
- `cuda`
- `hip`
- `esimd_emulator` (Deprecated)
- `*`

Possible values of `device_type` are:
- `host` (Deprecated)
- `cpu`
- `gpu`
- `acc`
- `*`

`device_num` is an integer that indexes the enumeration of devices from the sycl-ls utility tool, where the first device in that enumeration has index zero in each backend. For example, `SYCL_DEVICE_FILTER=2` will return all devices with index '2' from all different backends. If multiple devices satisfy this device number (e.g., GPU and CPU devices can be assigned device number '2'), then default_selector will choose the device with the highest heuristic point.  When `SYCL_DEVICE_ALLOWLIST` is set, it is applied before enumerating devices and affects `device_num` values.

Assuming a filter has all three elements of the triple, it selects only those devices that come from the given backend, have the specified device type, AND have the given device index. If more than one filter is specified, the RT is restricted to the union of devices selected by all filters.

Note that all device selectors will throw an exception if the filtered list of devices does not include a device that satisfies the selector. For instance, `SYCL_DEVICE_FILTER=cpu` will cause `gpu_selector()` to throw an exception. `SYCL_DEVICE_FILTER` also limits loading only specified plugins into the SYCL RT. In particular, `SYCL_DEVICE_FILTER=level_zero` will cause the `cpu_selector` to throw an exception since SYCL RT will only load the `level_zero` backend which does not support any CPU devices at this time. When multiple devices satisfy the filter (e..g, `SYCL_DEVICE_FILTER=gpu`), only one of them will be selected.

## `SYCL_REDUCTION_PREFERRED_WORKGROUP_SIZE`

This environment variable controls the preferred work-group size for reductions on specified device types. Setting this will affect all reductions without an explicitly specified work-group size on devices of types in the value of the environment variable.

The value of this environment variable is a comma separated list of one or more configurations, where each configuration is a pair of the form "`device_type`:`size`" (without the quotes). Possible values of `device_type` are:
- `cpu`
- `gpu`
- `acc`
- `*`

`size` is a positive integer larger than 0.

For a configuration `device_type`:`size` the `device_type` element specifies the type of device the configuration applies to, that is `cpu` is for CPU devices, `gpu` is for GPU devices, and `acc` is for accelerator devices. If `device_type` is `*` the configuration applies to all applicable device types. `size` denotes the preferred work-group size to be used for devices of types specified by `device_type`.

If `info::device::max_work_group_size` on a device on which a reduction is being enqueued is less than the value specified by a configuration in this environment variable, the value of `info::device::max_work_group_size` on that device is used instead.

A `sycl::exception` with `sycl::errc::invalid` is thrown during submission of a reduction kernel in the following cases:
- If the specified device type in any configuration is not one of the valid values.
- If the specified preferred work-group size in any configuration is not a valid integer.
- If the specified preferred work-group size in any configuration is not an integer value larger than 0.
- If any configuration does not have the `:` delimiter.

If this environment variable is not set, the preferred work-group size for reductions is implementation defined.

Note that conflicting configuration tuples in the same list will favor the last entry. For example, a list `cpu:32,gpu:32,cpu:16` will set the preferred work-group size of reductions to 32 for GPUs and 16 for CPUs. This also applies to `*`, for example `cpu:32,*:16` sets the preferred work-group size of reductions on all devices to 16, while `*:16,cpu:32` sets the preferred work-group size of reductions to 32 on CPUs and to 16 on all other devices.

## Debugging variables for Level Zero Plugin

:warning: **Warning:** <span style="color:red">the environment variables
described below are used for development and debugging of DPC++ compiler
and runtime. Their semantics are subject to change. Do not rely on these
variables in production code.</span>

| Environment variable | Values | Description |
| -------------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_SINGLE_THREAD_MODE` | Integer | A single-threaded app has an opportunity to enable this mode to avoid overhead from mutex locking in the Level Zero plugin. A value greater than 0 enables single thread mode. A value of 0 disables single thread mode. The default is 0. |
| `SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_USM_ALLOCATOR` | [EnableBuffers][;[MaxPoolSize][;[host\|device\|shared:][MaxPoolableSize][,[Capacity][,SlabMinSize]]]...] | EnableBuffers enables pooling for SYCL buffers, default 0, set to 1 to enable. MaxPoolSize is the maximum size of the pool, default 0. MemType is host, device or shared. Other parameters are values specified as positive integers with optional K, M or G suffix. MaxPoolableSize is the maximum allocation size that may be pooled, default 0 for host and shared, 32KB for device. Capacity is the number of allocations in each size range freed by the program but retained in the pool for reallocation, default 0. Size ranges follow this pattern: 64, 96, 128, 192, and so on, i.e., powers of 2, with one range in between. SlabMinSize is the minimum allocation size, 64KB for host and device, 2MB for shared. Example: SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_USM_ALLOCATOR=1;32M;host:1M,4,64K;device:1M,4,64K;shared:0,0,2M|
| `SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_BATCH_SIZE` | Integer | Sets a preferred number of compute commands to batch into a command list before executing the command list. A value of 0 causes the batch size to be adjusted dynamically. A value greater than 0 specifies fixed size batching, with the batch size set to the specified value. The default is 0. |
| `SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_COPY_BATCH_SIZE` | Integer | Sets a preferred number of copy commands to batch into a command list before executing the command list. A value of 0 causes the batch size to be adjusted dynamically. A value greater than 0 specifies fixed size batching, with the batch size set to the specified value. The default is 0. |
| `SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_FILTER_EVENT_WAIT_LIST` | Integer | When set to 0, disables filtering of signaled events from wait lists when using the Level Zero backend. The default is 0. |
| `SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_USE_COPY_ENGINE` | Any(\*) | This environment variable enables users to control use of copy engines for copy operations. If the value is an integer, it will allow the use of copy engines, if available in the device, in Level Zero plugin to transfer SYCL buffer or image data between the host and/or device(s) and to fill SYCL buffer or image data in device or shared memory. The value of this environment variable can also be a pair of the form "lower_index:upper_index" where the indices point to copy engines in a list of all available copy engines. The default is 0:0 when immediate command lists are being used on the device and 1 otherwise. (Also see description of SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_USE_IMMEDIATE_COMMANDLISTS). |
| `SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_USE_COMPUTE_ENGINE` | Integer | It can be set to an integer (>=0) in which case all compute commands will be submitted to the command-queue with the given index in the compute command group. If it is instead set to a negative value then all available compute engines may be used. The default value is "0" |
| `SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_USE_COPY_ENGINE_FOR_D2D_COPY` (experimental) | Integer | Allows the use of copy engine, if available in the device, in Level Zero plugin for device to device copy operations. The default is 0. This option is experimental and will be removed once heuristics are added to make a decision about use of copy engine for device to device copy operations. |
| `SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_DEVICE_SCOPE_EVENTS` | Any(\*) | Enable support of device-scope events whose state is not visible to the host. If enabled mode is SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_DEVICE_SCOPE_EVENTS=1 the Level Zero plugin would create all events having device-scope only and create proxy host-visible events for them when their status is needed (wait/query) on the host. If enabled mode is SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_DEVICE_SCOPE_EVENTS=2 the Level Zero plugin would create all events having device-scope and add proxy host-visible event at the end of each command-list submission. The default is 0, meaning all events have host visibility. SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_DEVICE_SCOPE_EVENTS is ignored when using immediate command lists (SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_USE_IMMEDIATE_COMMANDLISTS = 1) and all events use default scope of 0. |
| `SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_USE_IMMEDIATE_COMMANDLISTS` | Integer | When set to a positive value enables use of Level Zero immediate commandlists, which means there is no batching and all commands are immediately submitted for execution. When set to 1, unique immediate commandlists are created for each SYCL queue. When set to 2, unique immediate commandlists are created per host thread per SYCL queue. Default is 1 on Intel® Data Center GPU Max Series running Linux and 0 elsewhere. |
| `SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_USE_MULTIPLE_COMMANDLIST_BARRIERS` | Integer | When set to a positive value enables use of multiple Level Zero commandlists when submitting barriers. Default is 1. |
| `SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_USE_COPY_ENGINE_FOR_FILL` | Integer | When set to a positive value enables use of a copy engine for memory fill operations. Default is 0. |
| `SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_SINGLE_ROOT_DEVICE_BUFFER_MIGRATION` | Integer | When set to "0" tells to use single root-device allocation for all devices in a context where all devices have same root. Otherwise performs regular buffer migration. Default is 1. |
| `SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_REUSE_DISCARDED_EVENTS` | Integer |  When set to a positive value enables the mode when discarded Level Zero events are reset and reused in scope of the same in-order queue based on the dependency chain between commands. Default is 1. |
| `SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_EXPOSE_CSLICE_IN_AFFINITY_PARTITIONING` (Deprecated) | Integer | When set to non-zero value exposes compute slices as sub-sub-devices in `sycl::info::partition_property::partition_by_affinity_domain` partitioning scheme. Default is zero meaning that they are only exposed when partitioning by `sycl::info::partition_property::ext_intel_partition_by_cslice`. This option is introduced for compatibility reasons and is immediately deprecated. New code must not rely on this behavior. Also note that even if sub-sub-device was created using `partition_by_affinity_domain` it would still be reported as created via partitioning by compute slices. |
| `SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_COMMANDLISTS_CLEANUP_THRESHOLD` | Integer | If non-negative then the threshold is set to this value. If negative, the threshold is set to INT_MAX. Whenever the number of command lists in a queue exceeds this threshold, an attempt is made to cleanup completed command lists for their subsequent reuse. The default is 20. |
| `SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_IMMEDIATE_COMMANDLISTS_EVENT_CLEANUP_THRESHOLD` | Integer | If non-negative then the threshold is set to this value. If negative, the threshold is set to INT_MAX. Whenever the number of events associated with an immediate command list exceeds this threshold, a check is made for signaled events and these events are recycled. Setting this threshold low causes events to be checked more often, which could result in unneeded events being recycled sooner. However, more frequent event status checks may cost time. The default is 1000. |
| `SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_USM_RESIDENT` | Integer | Bit-mask controls if/where to make USM allocations resident at the time of allocation. Input value is of the form 0xHSD, where 4-bits of D control device allocations, 4-bits of S control shared allocations, and 4-bits of H control host allocations. Each 4-bit component is holding one of the following values: "0" - then no special residency is forced, "1" - then allocation is made resident at the device of allocation, or "2" - then allocation is made resident on all devices in the context of allocation that have P2P access to the device of allocation. Default is 0x002, i.e. force full residency for device allocations only. |
| `SYCL_PI_LEVEL_ZERO_USE_NATIVE_USM_MEMCPY2D` | Integer | When set to a positive value enables the use of Level Zero USM 2D memory copy operations. Default is 0. |

## Debugging variables for CUDA Plugin

:warning: **Warning:** <span style="color:red">the environment variables
described below are used for development and debugging of DPC++ compiler
and runtime. Their semantics are subject to change. Do not rely on these
variables in production code.</span>

| Environment variable | Values | Description |
| -------------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `SYCL_PI_CUDA_ENABLE_IMAGE_SUPPORT` (experimental) | Any(\*) | Enable support of images. This option is experimental since the image support is not fully implemented. |

`(*) Note: Any means this environment variable is effective when set to any non-null value.`

This extension is written against the SYCL 1.2.1 specification, Revision v1.2.1-6.

== Introduction

sRGB isn't an image data format, per se. It is a linearization of RGB color values that adjusts the color to be better matched with a particular hardware medium. A more detailed explanation may be found here: https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/using-opencl-20-srgb-image-format.html

OpenCL provides automatic linearization of RGB values into sRGB color space. OneAPI now exposes that OpenCL support for read_only images.

== Feature test macro

This extension provides a feature-test macro as described in the core SYCL
specification section 6.3.3 "Feature test macros".  Therefore, an
implementation supporting this extension must predefine the macro
`SYCL_EXT_ONEAPI_SRGB` to one of the values defined in the table below.
Applications can test for the existence of this macro to determine if the
implementation supports this feature, or applications can test the macro's
value to determine which of the extension's APIs the implementation supports.

== aspect::ext_oneapi_srgb
Since not all devices and backends support sRGB images, `aspect::ext_oneapi_srgb` is available to programmatically detect this.

----
 // someDevice is a sycl::device
 if(someDevice.has(aspect::ext_oneapi_srgb)){ ... }

== New ImageChannelOrder Enums

sRGB values have been added to the `image_channel_order` enumeration. The `image_channel_order::ext_oneapi_srgba` value allows images to be read with sRGB linearization of the color values. This value can be passed to `image` constructors, with some limitations that are outlined below.

== Limitations of sRGB usage

There are five primary limitations of which any potential user should be aware.

. 2D and 3D images only. 
. unorm_int8 channel type (only)
. read_only access to image 
. const data required when initializing image.
. OpenCL backend only at this time.

Three of these are limitations to the construction of the image object itself, and will typically result in a `CL_IMAGE_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED` error if exceeded. 

=== 2D and 3D images only.
The title is self explanatory. For the new sRGB support, OneAPI does not support 1D sRGB images. They must be 2D or 3D images.

=== unorm_int8 channel type (only)
sRGB images can *only* be created with the `image_channel_type::unorm_int8` channel type. This is an 8-bit per channel type, normalized to a low accuracy floating point on read. 

=== read_only access to image
The OneAPI support for sRGB images at this time is read_only. Be sure to only request read access mode accessors, not write or read_write.

=== const data required when initializing image
As a consequence of the read_only limitation, the image must be initialized with user data upon construction, and that data must be `const`.

=== OpenCL backend only at this time
The sRGB enablement is available on OpenCL, but no other backends at this time.   

== Example

[source]
----
using accessorPixelT = sycl::float4; // we access the image data as four floats
using dataPixelT = uint32_t;         // but the underlying data is merely 32 bit per pixel (four 8 bit values)

// this should yield a read of approximate 0.5 for each channel
// when read directly with a normal non-linearized image (e.g. image_channel_order::rgba).  
// For sRGB (image_channel_order::ext_oneapi_srgba), this is the value that will experience maximum conversion/linearization. 
// So we should read values of approximately 0.2 
dataPixelT basicPixel{127 << 24 | 127 << 16 | 127 << 8 | 127};

const sycl::range<2> ImgRange_2D(width, height);

// Make a 2D image with every pixel initialized to basicPixel.
// IMPORTANT: const data is *required* for sRGBA images.
// OpenCL support is limited for 2D/3D images that are read only.
const std::vector<dataPixelT> ImgData(ImgRange_2D.size(), basicPixel);

image<2> image_2D(ImgData.data(), image_channel_order::srgba, image_channel_type::unorm_int8, ImgRange_2D);

queue Q;
Q.submit([&](handler &cgh) {
    // read only accessor
    auto image_acc = image_2D.get_access<accessorPixelT, access::mode::read>(cgh);

    cgh.parallel_for<class sRGAExample>(ImgRange_2D, [=](sycl::item<2> Item) {
        accessorPixelT Data = image_acc.read(sycl::int2{Item[0], Item[1]});
        // in our example, Data will be approximately {0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.5}
        // ie, the color was linearized, the alpha value was untouched
        // etc.
----

And to run, be sure to select the OpenCL backend (works on both CPU and GPU devices)

== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SYCL 2020 revision 6 specification. All
references below to the "core SYCL specification" or to section numbers in the
SYCL specification refer to that revision.


== Status

This extension is supported by {dpcpp} on all backends except OpenCL.
[NOTE]
====
Currently support for OpenCL backend is limited, API introduced by this extension
can be called only for in-order queues which doesn't have `discard_events` property.
Exception is thrown if new API is called on other type of queue. OpenCL currently
doesn't have an API to get queue status.

== Overview

:cuda-stream: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/group__CUDART__STREAM.html#group__CUDART__STREAM_1g2021adeb17905c7ec2a3c1bf125c5435

This extension adds a new API that tells whether a `queue` is empty, similar to
the CUDA function {cuda-stream}[CudaStreamQuery].


== Specification

This extension provides a feature-test macro as described in the core SYCL
specification. An implementation supporting this extension must predefine the
macro `SYCL_EXT_ONEAPI_QUEUE_EMPTY` to one of the values defined in the table
below. Applications can test for the existence of this macro to determine if
the implementation supports this feature, or applications can test the macro's
value to determine which of the extension's features the implementation
supports.

=== New queue member function

This extension adds the following new member function to the `queue` class.

[source,c++]
----
namespace sycl {

class queue {
 bool ext_oneapi_empty() const;
};

} // namespace sycl
----

The semantics of the new function are:

Returns `true` if all commands previously submitted to this queue have
completed at the point when this function is called.

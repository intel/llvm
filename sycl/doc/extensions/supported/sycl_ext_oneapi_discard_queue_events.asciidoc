:dpcpp: pass:[DPC++]

This extension has been deprecated, but the specification is still available
link:../deprecated/sycl_ext_oneapi_discard_queue_events.asciidoc[here].
This extension no longer provides any benefit.  Although the interfaces defined
in this specification are still supported in {dpcpp}, we expect that they will
be removed in an upcoming {dpcpp} release.  The optimizations enabled by these
interfaces have already been disabled in the compiler.  The functionality of
this extension has been replaced by the sycl_ext_oneapi_enqueue_functions
extension: see link:../experimental/sycl_ext_oneapi_enqueue_functions.asciidoc[here].
*Shipping software products should stop using APIs defined in this
specification and use this alternative instead.*

== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SYCL 2020 revision 6 specification.  All
references below to the "core SYCL specification" or to section numbers in the
SYCL specification refer to that revision.

== Status

This extension is implemented and fully supported by {dpcpp}.
[NOTE]
====
Although {dpcpp} supports this extension on all backends, it is currently used
on Level Zero, CUDA, and HIP.
Other backends ignore the properties defined in this specification.
====

== Overview

Introduce SYCL queue properties specifying the desired priority of a queue.
These priorities are a hint and may be ignored if not supported by
underlying backends. 

== Specification

=== Feature test macro

This extension provides a feature-test macro as described in the core SYCL
specification.  An implementation supporting this extension must predefine
the macro `SYCL_EXT_ONEAPI_QUEUE_PRIORITY` to one of the values defined
in the table below.  Applications can test for the existence of this macro
to determine if the implementation supports this feature, or applications
can test the macro's value to determine which of the extension's features
the implementation supports.

=== API of the extension

This extension adds support for new properties for SYCL queue constructors
taking properties list:

```c++
namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::property::queue {

  class priority_normal {
  public:
    priority_normal() = default;
  };
  class priority_low {
  public:
    priority_low() = default;
  };
  class priority_high {
  public:
    priority_high() = default;
  };

} // namespace
```
The new properties hint the SYCL runtime that the queue gets the specified
priority for execution if supported by underlying target runtimes. These
properties are hints and may safely be ignored by an implementation.

It is illegal to specify multiple differrent priority hints for the same queue.
Doing so causes the `queue` constructor to throw a synchronous `exception` with
the `errc::invalid` error code.

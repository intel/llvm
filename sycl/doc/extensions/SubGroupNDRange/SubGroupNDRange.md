The sub-group extension has been split into two extensions, which can be found below:
- [SubGroup](../SubGroup/)
- [SubGroupAlgorithms](../SubGroupAlgorithms/)

Some existing sub-group functionality has been deprecated as part of this change, and will be removed in a future version of the compiler.

The sub-group extension has been split into two extensions, which can be found below:
- [SubGroup](../SubGroup/)
- [SubGroupAlgorithms](../SubGroupAlgorithms/)

The previous extension is archived [here](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/fba2e0602550a86c74149d9875b788ad1117f8d3/sycl/doc/extensions/SubGroupNDRange/SubGroupNDRange.md).

Some existing sub-group functionality has been deprecated as part of this change, and will be removed in a future version of the compiler.

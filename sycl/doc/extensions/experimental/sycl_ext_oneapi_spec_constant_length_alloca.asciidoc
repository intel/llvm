== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SYCL 2020 revision 8 specification.  All
references below to the "core SYCL specification" or to section numbers in the
SYCL specification refer to that revision.


== Status

This is an experimental extension specification, intended to provide early
access to features and gather community feedback.  Interfaces defined in this
specification are implemented in {dpcpp}, but they are not finalized and may
change incompatibly in future versions of {dpcpp} without prior notice.
*Shipping software products should not rely on APIs defined in this
specification.*

== Backend support status

The APIs in this extension may be used only on a device that has
`aspect::ext_oneapi_scla`. The application must check that the device has this
aspect before submitting a kernel using any of the APIs in this extension. If
the application fails to do this, the implementation throws a synchronous
exception with the `errc::kernel_not_supported` error code when the kernel is
submitted to the queue.

== Overview

C++ arrays and `std::array` can be used in SYCL code to represent fixed-size
sequences of objects. However, these constructs have a significant restriction:
the number of elements must be known at compile time. In host-code context,
users can make use of dynamic memory allocations, e.g., `std::vector`, but this
is not the case in SYCL device code.

SYCL specialization constants (SYCL Section 4.9.5.) can be used to represent
constants whose values can be set dynamically during the execution of a SYCL
application, but that will not change when a SYCL kernel function is
invoked. This way, specialization constants could be used to implement SYCL
private arrays whose size is given during the execution of the SYCL
application. There is no possible way of implementing this using `std::array`,
as the size of such containers must be known at compile time, so we propose to
define a new `private_alloca` function whose size is specified using SYCL
specialization constants.

== Specification

=== Feature test macro

This extension provides a feature-test macro as described in the core SYCL
specification.  An implementation supporting this extension must predefine the
macro `SYCL_EXT_ONEAPI_SPEC_CONSTANT_LENGTH_ALLOCA` to one of the values defined
in the table below. Applications can test for the existence of this macro to
determine if the implementation supports this feature, or applications can test
the macro's value to determine which of the extension's features the
implementation supports.

=== New Aspect for Specification Constant-Length Allocations

This extension adds a new device aspect:

[source,c++]
----
namespace sycl {
enum class aspect : /*unspecified*/ {
  ext_oneapi_scla
};
} // namespace sycl
----

The `ext_oneapi_scla` aspect indicates that the device is capable of using the
`private_alloca` API defined in the following sections.

=== The `private_alloca` function

[source,c++]
----
namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental {
template <typename ElementType, auto &SpecName,
          access::decorated DecorateAddress>
private_ptr<ElementType, DecorateAddress>
private_alloca(kernel_handler &kh);
} // namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental
----
_Mandates_: `ElementType` must be a cv-unqualified trivial type and `SpecName`
must be a reference to a specialization constant of integral `value_type`.

_Preconditions_: `SpecName` has a default value of at least 1 and is not set to
a value less than 1 during program execution.

_Effects_: `h.get_specialization_constant<size>()` elements of type
`ElementType` are allocated and default initialized in the stack.

_Returns_: A pointer to a default initialized region of private memory of
`h.get_specialization_constant<size>()` elements of type
`ElementType`. `DecorateAddress` defines whether the returned `multi_ptr` is
decorated.

_Remarks_: In case of private memory exhaustion, the underlying backend must
report an error in the same fashion as if the allocation size were static.. In
case of a successful call, memory is freed automatically when the function which
called `private_alloca` returns to its caller.

== Example usage

This non-normative section shows some example usages of the extension.

[source,c++]
----
constexpr specialization_id<int> size(1);

class Kernel;

SYCL_EXTERNAL void impl(const float *in, float *out, size_t n,
                        decorated_private_ptr<float> ptr);

void run(queue q, const float *in, float *out, size_t n) {
  q.submit([&](handler &h) {
    h.set_specialization_constant<size>(n);
    h.parallel_for<Kernel>(n, [=](id<1> i, kernel_handler kh) {
      // Allocate memory for 'n' 'float's
      auto ptr = private_alloca<float, size, access::decorated::yes>(kh);
      // Use pointer in implementation
      impl(in, out, kh.get_specialization_constant<size>(), ptr);
    });
  });
----

== Design Constraints

The big design constraint stems from the unknown allocation size at compile
time. C++ does not support variable length arrays and complete type sizes must
be known at compile time. Thus, the free function interface returning a pointer
to private memory is the better way to represent this construct in C++. Lifetime
of the underlying memory region was a concern too, but the current design
automatically freeing the memory when the caller is returned is in line with
similar constructs in other platforms.

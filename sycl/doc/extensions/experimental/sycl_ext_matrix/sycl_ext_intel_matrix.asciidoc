== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SYCL 2020 revision 6 specification.  All
references below to the "core SYCL specification" or to section numbers in the
SYCL specification refer to that revision.

This extension also depends on the following other SYCL extensions:

* link:sycl_ext_oneapi_matrix.asciidoc[sycl_ext_oneapi_matrix]

== Status
This is an experimental extension specification, intended to provide early
access to features and gather community feedback.  Interfaces defined in this
specification are implemented in {dpcpp}, but they are not finalized and may
change incompatibly in future versions of {dpcpp} without prior notice.
*Shipping software products should not rely on APIs defined in this
specification.*

== Backend support status
This document describes the extra features and details for the
implementation of `joint_matrix` extension on Intel AMX and Intel
XMX.

The APIs in this extension may be used only on a device that has
`aspect::ext_intel_matrix`. The application must check that the device
has this aspect before submitting a kernel using any of the APIs in
this extension. If the application fails to do this, the
implementation throws a synchronous exception with the
`errc::kernel_not_supported` error code when the kernel is submitted to
the queue.

== Overview
This extension provides additional APIs related to the `joint_matrix`
type that can be used only on Intel devices that have Intel AMX or
Intel XMX technology. These Intel devices also support all of the
generic matrix APIs specified in `sycl_ext_oneapi_matrix`, but
applications can make use of the extended Intel specific APIs in this
extension to gain additional performance and capabilities.

== Specification

=== Feature test macro

This extension provides a feature-test macro as described in the core SYCL
specification. An implementation supporting this extension must
predefine the macro `SYCL_EXT_INTEL_MATRIX` to one of the values
defined in the table below. Applications can test for the existence of
this macro to determine if the implementation supports this feature,
or applications can test the macro's value to determine which of the
extension's APIs the implementation supports.

|Value
|Description

|1
|The APIs of this experimental extension are not versioned, so the
 feature-test macro always has this value.
|===

=== New Aspect for Intel-Specific Matrix APIs
This extension adds a new device aspect:
```c++
namespace sycl {

enum class aspect : /*unspecified*/ {
  ext_intel_matrix
};

} // namespace sycl
```
The `ext_intel_matrix` aspect indicates that the device is capable of
using the extended joint matrix APIs that are defined in the sections
that follow.

=== New Layout Type
This extension adds a new layout type named `ext_intel_packed` which
an application can use to indicate that the matrix data is loaded or
stored in VNNI "packed" format.

```c++
namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::matrix::layout {

enum class layout {
  ext_intel_packed
};

} // namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::matrix
```

Consequently, the layout argument `layout` in `joint_matrix_load` can
take `ext_intel_packed` as argument to specify that the data has
already been transformed into VNNI format. In this case, the `stride`
argument of `joint_matrix_load` describes the number of elements
between consecutive rows for packed layouts.

In order to get maximum performance on Intel AMX and Intel XMX,
prepacking data in the memory is necessary. If users did not specify
the packed layouts, transforms done by the implementation may be slow
due to extra scatter/gather operations. Hence, we expose the
`ext_intel_packed` layout to the user to specify that A or B have
already been VNNIed. The packed or VNNI layout is introduced in the
`VNNI layout` section below.

=== Additional Store Operations
Besides store of matrix `accumulator`, the Intel implementation allows
store on matrix `a` and `b` as well.

```c++
namespace sycl::ext::intel::experimental::matrix {

template <typename Group, typename T, size_t Rows, size_t Cols,
          layout Layout, access::address_space Space,
          access::decorated IsDecorated>
void joint_matrix_store(Group g,
    const joint_matrix<Group, T, use::a, Rows, Cols, Layout> &res,
    multi_ptr<T, Space, IsDecorated> dest, size_t stride);

template <typename Group, typename T, size_t Rows, size_t Cols,
          layout Layout, access::address_space Space,
          access::decorated IsDecorated>
void joint_matrix_store(Group g,
    const joint_matrix<Group, T, use::b, Rows, Cols, Layout> &res,
    multi_ptr<T, Space, IsDecorated> dest, size_t stride);

template <typename Group, typename T, size_t Rows, size_t Cols,
          layout Layout, typename PropertyListT>
void joint_matrix_store(Group g,
    const joint_matrix<Group, T, use::a, Rows, Cols, Layout> &res,
    ext::oneapi::experimental::annotated_ptr<T, PropertyListT> dest,
    size_t stride);

template <typename Group, typename T, size_t Rows, size_t Cols,
          layout Layout, typename PropertyListT>
void joint_matrix_store(Group g,
    const joint_matrix<Group, T, use::b, Rows, Cols, Layout> &res,
    ext::oneapi::experimental::annotated_ptr<T, PropertyListT> dest,
    size_t stride);

} // namespace sycl::ext::intel::experimental::matrix
```

=== Per-element Access with Coordinates
The function `joint_matrix_apply` in `sycl_ext_oneapi_matrix` provides
a way for the application to apply the same operation on every element
of the matrix. However, some algorithms require the application to
know the coordinates of each element as it operates on them. In this
case, the joint matrix index must be known in order to reason about
the matrix view and extract the relevant piece such as a sum of all
elements in a row for example. For instance, quantization that is
needed for conversion between low precision types like `int8_t` and `fp32`
uses such logic.

This extension adds a new form of the `joint_matrix_apply` function in
the `sycl::ext::intel::matrix` namespace that allows the application
to perform an operation on each element of the matrix. This function
is similar to the form in `sycl_ext_oneapi_joint_matrix`, but it also
provides the matrix coordinates of each element to the callback
function:

```c++
namespace sycl::ext::intel::experimental::matrix {

template<typename Group, typename T, use Use, size_t Rows, size_t
         Cols, layout Layout, typename F>
void joint_matrix_apply(Group g, joint_matrix<Group, T, Use, Rows,
                        Cols, Layout>& C, F&& func);

} // namespace sycl::ext::intel::experimental::matrix
```
The `func` callback is invoked with three parameters `(T& element,
size_t row, size_t col)`, where `row` and `col` tell the coordinates
of element in the joint matrix. To illustrate, the following example
shows how you can use this API to sum the rows of a matrix:

```c++
joint_matrix_apply(sg, A, [=](T &val, size_t row, size_t  col) {
   sum_local_rows[row] += val;
});
```

In the case of `ext_intel_packed` matrix memory layout, `row` and
`col` represent the coordinates in the logical matrix before VNNI
transformation.

=== New Device Information Descriptor
Besides the query we provide in
link:sycl_ext_oneapi_matrix.asciidoc[sycl_ext_oneapi_matrix],
some device descriptors are Intel hardware specific. These are
provided as part of `ext::intel::experimental::info::device::matrix`
namespace:

[frame="none",options="header"]
|======================
| Device descriptors | Return type| Description
|`ext::intel::experimental::info::device::matrix::numtiles`| `int`
|If the matrix hardware in the device has separate storage (register
files or tiles) from the rest of the processing units (e.g. Intel
AMX), returns the number of tiles. For other devices, returns 0.
|======================

=== Packed Layout Format
The `ext_intel_packed` layout (aka VNNI) is a special layout for
matrix data that allows Intel AMX and Intel XMX devices to load
matrices more efficiently (packing in 32 bits). This layout applies
only to the A and B matrices, and may not be used with the accumulator
matrix. The layout is different depending on whether the matrix
element type is 8 bits or 16 bits, which are the only two element
sizes supported for the A and B matrices on Intel AMX and Intel XMX
devices.

For an 8-bit element, the first four elements of column 0 are stored
contiguously in memory, followed by the first four elements of column
1, etc. This continues until the end of the row. After all the
elements for rows 0 - 3 have been stored this way, the process
repeats, starting with the next four elements of column 0. The diagram
below illustrates this layout for a 8 x 4 matrix.

==== Example 1: 8-bit elements

      // Example of a 8 row x 4 column matrix using a 8-bit data
      // element, in row-major layout, rows are shown horizontally.
      // Element a1 is contiguous in memory with element b1, etc.
      // ---------------------------------
      // a1, b1, c1, d1
      // a2, b2, c2, d2
      // a3, b3, c3, d3
      // a4, b4, c4, d4
      // a5, b5, c5, d5
      // a6, b6, c6, d6
      // a7, b7, c7, d7
      // a8, b8, c8, d8
      // ---------------------------------
      // The same matrix reformatted in packed layout.
      // Here, packing of 4 elements is needed to form 32 bits.
      // Elements a1, a2, a3, a4 are contiguous in memory, etc.
      // ---------------------------------
      // a1, a2, a3, a4, b1, b2, b3, b4, c1, c2, c3, c4, d1, d2, d3, d4
      // a5, a6, a7, a8, b5, b6, b7, b8, c5, c6, c7, c8, d5, d6, d7, d8

For a 16-bit element, the first two elements of column 0 are stored
contiguously in memory, followed by the first two elements of column
1, etc. This continues until the end of the row. After all the
elements for rows 0 - 1 have been stored this way, the process
repeats, starting with the next two elements of column 0. The diagram
below illustrates this layout for a 4 x 4 matrix.

==== Example 2: 16-bit elements
      // Example of a 4 row x 4 column matrix using a 16-bit data
      // element, in row-major layout.
      // Element a1 is contiguous in memory with element b1, etc.
      // ---------------------------------
      // a1, b1, c1, d1
      // a2, b2, c2, d2
      // a3, b3, c3, d3
      // a4, b4, c4, d4
      // ---------------------------------
      // The same matrix reformatted in packed layout.
      // Here, packing of 2 elements is needed to form 32 bits.
      // Element a1 is contiguous in memory with element a2, etc.
      // ---------------------------------
      // a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, c2, d1, d2
      // a3, a4, b3, b4, c3, c4, d3, d4

  });
});

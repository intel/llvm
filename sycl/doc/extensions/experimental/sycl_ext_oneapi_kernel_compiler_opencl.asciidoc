== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SYCL 2020 revision 8 specification.
All references below to the "core SYCL specification" or to section numbers in
the SYCL specification refer to that revision.

This extension also depends on the following other SYCL extensions:

* link:../experimental/sycl_ext_oneapi_kernel_compiler.asciidoc[
  sycl_ext_oneapi_kernel_compiler]


== Status

This is an experimental extension specification, intended to provide early
access to features and gather community feedback. Interfaces defined in
this specification are implemented in {dpcpp}, but they are not finalized
and may change incompatibly in future versions of {dpcpp} without prior notice.
*Shipping software products should not rely on APIs defined in
this specification.*


== Overview

This is an extension to
link:../experimental/sycl_ext_oneapi_kernel_compiler.asciidoc[
sycl_ext_oneapi_kernel_compiler], which allows an application to define a
kernel in the OpenCL C language when dynamically compiling a kernel from
source.


== Specification

=== Feature test macro

This extension provides a feature-test macro as described in the core SYCL
specification.
An implementation supporting this extension must predefine the macro
`SYCL_EXT_ONEAPI_KERNEL_COMPILER_OPENCL`
to one of the values defined in the table below.
Applications can test for the existence of this macro to determine if the
implementation supports this feature, or applications can test the macro's
value to determine which of the extension's features the implementation
supports.

[%header,cols="1,5"]
|===
|Value
|Description

|1
|The APIs of this experimental extension are not versioned, so the
 feature-test macro always has this value.
|===

=== New source language enumerator

This extension adds the `opencl` enumerator to the `source_language`
enumeration, which indicates that a kernel bundle defines kernels in the
OpenCL C language.

[source,c++]
----
namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental {

enum class source_language : /*unspecified*/ {
  // ...
  opencl
};

} // namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental
----

=== Source code is text format

Kernels written in the `opencl` language are text format.
As a result, the application must use the overload of
`create_kernel_bundle_from_source` taking `std::string` when creating a kernel
bundle from this language.

=== Build options

The `build_options` property accepts any of the compiler or linker options
defined by the OpenCL specification, except for those that are specific to
creating an OpenCL library.
The kernel compiler can be used to create an OpenCL program, but not an OpenCL
library.

=== Obtaining a kernel

OpenCL C kernel functions do not support {cpp} features like overloads or
templates.
As a result, the function name itself uniquely identifies the kernel function.
Therefore, the `ext_oneapi_has_kernel` and `ext_oneapi_get_kernel` member
functions identify a kernel using the function name, exactly as it appears in
the OpenCL C source code.
For example, if the kernel is defined this way in OpenCL C:

[source,c++]
----
__kernel
void foo(__global int *in, __global int *out) {/*...*/}
----

Then the application's host code can query for the kernel like so:

[source,c++]
----
sycl::kernel_bundle<sycl::bundle_state::executable> kb = /*...*/;
sycl::kernel k = kb.ext_oneapi_get_kernel("foo");
----

=== Kernel argument restrictions

The following table defines the set of OpenCL C kernel argument types that are
supported by this extension and explains how to pass each type of argument from
SYCL.

[%header,cols="1,1"]
|===
|OpenCL C type
|Corresponding SYCL type

|One of the OpenCL C scalar types (e.g. `int`, `float`, etc.)
|A {cpp} type that is device copyable, which has the same width and data
 representation.

[_Note:_ Applications typically use the corresponding OpenCL type (e.g.
`cl_int`, `cl_float`, etc.)
_{endnote}_]

|A `+__global+` pointer.
|Either a {cpp} pointer (typically a pointer to USM memory) or an `accessor`
 whose target is `target::device`.

|A `+__local+` pointer.
|A `local_accessor`.

[_Note:_ The `local_accessor` merely conveys the size of the local memory, such
that the kernel argument points to a local memory buffer of _N_ bytes, where
_N_ is the value returned by `local_accessor::byte_size`.
If the application wants to pass other information from the `local_accessor` to
the kernel (such as the value _N_), it must pass this as separate kernel
arguments.
_{endnote}_]

|A class (or struct) passed by value.
|A {cpp} struct or class that is device copyable, which has the same size and
 data representation as the OpenCL C struct.

[_Note:_ The SYCL argument must not contain any `accessor` or `local_accessor`
members because these types are not device copyable.
If the OpenCL C structure contains a pointer member, the corresponding SYCL
structure member is typically a USM pointer.
_{endnote}_]
|===

When data allocated on the host is accessed by the kernel via a pointer, the
application must ensure that the data has the same size and representation on
the host and inside the OpenCL C kernel.
Applications can use the OpenCL types (e.g. `cl_int`) for this purpose.


== Example

The following example shows a simple SYCL program that defines an OpenCL C
kernel as a string and then compiles and launches it.

[source,c++]
----
#include <sycl/sycl.hpp>
#include <CL/opencl.h>
namespace syclex = sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental;

int main() {
  sycl::queue q;

  // Kernel defined as an OpenCL C string.  This could be dynamically
  // generated instead of a literal.
  std::string source = R"""(
    __kernel void my_kernel(__global int *in, __global int *out) {
      size_t i = get_global_id(0);
      out[i] = in[i]*2 + 100;
    }
  )""";

  sycl::kernel_bundle<sycl::bundle_state::ext_oneapi_source> kb_src =
    syclex::create_kernel_bundle_from_source(
      q.get_context(),
      syclex::source_language::opencl,
      source);

  // Compile and link the kernel from the source definition.
  sycl::kernel_bundle<sycl::bundle_state::executable> kb_exe =
    syclex::build(kb_src);

  // Get a "kernel" object representing the kernel defined in the
  // source string.
  sycl::kernel k = kb_exe.ext_oneapi_get_kernel("my_kernel");

  constexpr int N = 4;
  cl_int input[N] = {0, 1, 2, 3};
  cl_int output[N] = {};

  sycl::buffer inputbuf(input, sycl::range{N});
  sycl::buffer outputbuf(output, sycl::range{N});

  q.submit([&](sycl::handler &cgh) {
    sycl::accessor in{inputbuf, cgh, sycl::read_only};
    sycl::accessor out{outputbuf, cgh, sycl::read_write};

    // Each argument to the kernel is a SYCL accessor.
    cgh.set_args(in, out);

    // Invoke the kernel over a range.
    cgh.parallel_for(sycl::range{N}, k);
  });
}
----


== Issues

* How should we expose the difference between OpenCL C versions?
  It seems like there are two aspects to the problem.
  Applications need some way to query which versions the backend (or device)
  supports.
  Applications also need some way to tell the runtime which version the kernel
  is written in.
+
--
One option is to define separate enumerators in `source_language` for each
version like this:

```
enum class source_language : /*unspecified*/ {
  opencl_1_0,
  opencl_1_1,
  opencl_2_0,
  opencl_3_0,
};
```

Applications could then query the supported versions via
`is_source_kernel_bundle_supported`, and applications would identify the
version of their kernel string via the `lang` parameter to
`create_kernel_bundle_from_source`.

Alternatively, this extension could define just a single language enumerator
(`opencl`), but also provide as separate query to get the supported OpenCL C
versions.
When building a kernel bundle, applications would be required to pass "-cl-std"
via the `build_options` property in order to identify the OpenCL C version of
their source string.
--

* How can an application determine the OpenCL C optional features that are
  supported and the extensions that are supported?
  One option is to require the application to use OpenCL APIs for these
  queries.
  This seems better than duplicating these queries into this extension.
  However, this assumes the application is running with an OpenCL backend.
  Do we want to support the use of OpenCL C kernels also with the Level Zero
  backend?
  Currently, the online_compiler does support this case (but it provides no way
  to query about optional features or extensions).

* Do we need to document some restrictions on the OpenCL C
  https://registry.khronos.org/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/html/OpenCL_C.html#work-item-functions[
  work-item functions] that the kernel can call, which depends on how the
  kernel was launched?
  For example, can a kernel launched with the simple `range` form of
  `parallel_for` call `get_local_size`?
  In OpenCL, there is only one way to launch kernels
  (`clEnqueueNDRangeKernel`), so it is always legal to call any of the
  work-item functions.
  If an OpenCL kernel is launched with a NULL `local_work_size` (which is
  roughly equivalent to SYCL's `range` form of `parallel_for`), the
  `get_local_size` function returns the local work-group size that is chosen by
  the implementation.
  Level Zero, similarly, has only one way to launch kernels.
  Therefore, maybe it is OK to let kernels in this extension call any of the
  work-item functions, regardless of how they are launched?

to pipes.

== Notice

Copyright (c) 2022-2023 Intel Corporation.  All rights reserved.

== Status

This is an experimental extension specification, intended to provide early
access to features and gather community feedback.  Interfaces defined in this
specification are implemented in {dpcpp}, but they are not finalized and may
change incompatibly in future versions of {dpcpp} without prior notice.
*Shipping software products should not rely on APIs defined in this
specification.*

== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SYCL 2020 specification, Revision 6 and
the following extensions:

- link:../supported/sycl_ext_intel_dataflow_pipes.asciidoc[SYCL_INTEL_data_flow_pipes]
- link:../experimental/sycl_ext_oneapi_properties.asciidoc[sycl_ext_oneapi_properties]

== Overview

This extension introduces properties that establish differences in the
implementation of `sycl::ext::intel::experimental::pipe`. These properties are FPGA specific. An example
of the syntax can be seen below. 

[source,c++]
----
using pipe = pipe<class some_pipe, int, min_capacity, decltype(properties{uses_valid<true>})>;
----

== Feature test macro

This extension provides a feature-test macro as described in the core SYCL
specification section 6.3.3 "Feature test macros". Therefore, an implementation
supporting this extension must predefine the macro
`SYCL_EXT_INTEL_FPGA_PIPE_PROPERTIES` to one of the values defined in the table
below. Applications can test for the existence of this macro to determine if
the implementation supports this feature, or applications can test the macro's
value to determine which of the extension's APIs the implementation supports.

=== Pipe properties

Below is a list of compile-time-constant properties which `pipe` supports.

```c++
namespace sycl::ext::intel::experimental {

struct ready_latency_key {
  template <int Latency>
  using value_t = oneapi::experimental::property_value<
      ready_latency_key, std::integral_constant<int, Latency>>;
};

struct bits_per_symbol_key {
  template <int Bits>
  using value_t =
      oneapi::experimental::property_value<bits_per_symbol_key,
                                           std::integral_constant<int, Bits>>;
};

struct uses_valid_key {
  template <bool Valid>
  using value_t =
      oneapi::experimental::property_value<uses_valid_key,
                                           std::bool_constant<Valid>>;
};  
    
struct first_symbol_in_high_order_bits_key {
  template <bool HighOrder>
  using value_t =
      oneapi::experimental::property_value<first_symbol_in_high_order_bits_key,
                                           std::bool_constant<HighOrder>>;
};

enum class protocol_name : /* unspecified */ {
  avalon_streaming = 0,
  avalon_streaming_uses_ready = 1,
  avalon_mm = 2,
  avalon_mm_uses_ready = 3
};

struct protocol_key {
  template <protocol_name Protocol>
  using value_t = oneapi::experimental::property_value<
      protocol_key, std::integral_constant<protocol_name, Protocol>>;
};

template <int Latency>
inline constexpr ready_latency_key::value_t<Latency> ready_latency;

template <int Bits>
inline constexpr bits_per_symbol_key::value_t<Bits> bits_per_symbol;

template <bool Valid>
inline constexpr uses_valid_key::value_t<Valid> uses_valid;

template <bool HighOrder>
inline constexpr first_symbol_in_high_order_bits_key::value_t<HighOrder>
    first_symbol_in_high_order_bits;

template <protocol_name Protocol>
inline constexpr protocol_key::value_t<Protocol> protocol;

} // namespace sycl::ext::intel::experimental

| Property | Description

|`ready_latency`
| Valid values: Non-negative integer value.

Default value: 0

The number of cycles between when the ready signal is deasserted and when the
pipe can no longer accept new inputs.

This property is not guaranteed to be respected if the pipe is an inter-kernel
pipe. The compiler is allowed to optimize the pipe if both sides are visible.

|`bits_per_symbol`
| Valid values: A positive integer value that evenly divides by the data type size. 

Default value: 8

Describes how the data is broken into symbols on the data bus.

Data is broken down according to how you set the `first_symbol_in_high_order_bits`
property. By default, data is broken down in little endian order.

This property is not guaranteed to be respected if the pipe is an inter-kernel
pipe. The compiler is allowed to optimize the pipe if both sides are visible.

|`uses_valid`
| Valid values: `true` or `false`

Default value: `true`

Controls whether a valid signal is present on the pipe interface. If `false`, the
upstream source must provide valid data on every cycle that ready is asserted.

This is equivalent to changing the pipe read calls to a non-blocking call and assuming that
success is always true.

If set to `false`, the `min_capacity` pipe class template parameter and `ready_latency`
property must be 0.

This property is not guaranteed to be respected if the pipe is an inter-kernel
pipe. The compiler is allowed to optimize the pipe if both sides are visible.

|`first_symbol_in_high_order_bits`
| Valid values: true or false

Default value: false

Specifies whether the data symbols in the pipe are in big-endian
order.

This property is not guaranteed to be respected if the pipe is an inter-kernel
pipe. The compiler is allowed to optimize the pipe if both sides are visible.

|`protocol`
| Specifies the protocol for the pipe interface. Currently, the protocols supported
are: *avalon_streaming*, *avalon_streaming_uses_ready*, *avalon_mm*, and *avalon_mm_uses_ready*.

*avalon_streaming*

Provide an Avalon streaming interface as described in https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683091/22-3/introduction-to-the-interface-specifications.html[Intel速 Avalon Interface Specifications].

With this choice of protocol, no ready signal is exposed by the host pipe, and the sink cannot backpressure.

*avalon_streaming_uses_ready*

Provide an Avalon streaming interface as described in https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683091/22-3/introduction-to-the-interface-specifications.html[Intel速 Avalon Interface Specifications].

This protocol allows the sink to backpressure by deasserting the ready signal asserted. The sink signifies that it is ready to consume data by asserting the ready signal. 

*avalon_mm*

Provide an Avalon memory mapped interface as described in https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683091/22-3/introduction-to-the-interface-specifications.html[Intel速 Avalon Interface Specifications].

With this protocol, an implicit ready signal is held high, and the sink cannot backpressure.

*avalon_mm_uses_ready*

Provide an Avalon memory mapped interface as described in https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683091/22-3/introduction-to-the-interface-specifications.html[Intel速 Avalon Interface Specifications].

With this protocol, an additional memory mapped location is created to hold the ready signal. You must set the `uses_valid` property to `true`.

The default protocol is *avalon_streaming_uses_ready*

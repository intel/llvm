== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SYCL 2020 revision 9 specification.  All
references below to the "core SYCL specification" or to section numbers in the
SYCL specification refer to that revision.


== Status

This is an experimental extension specification, intended to provide early
access to features and gather community feedback.  Interfaces defined in this
specification are implemented in {dpcpp}, but they are not finalized and may
change incompatibly in future versions of {dpcpp} without prior notice.
*Shipping software products should not rely on APIs defined in this
specification.*


== Overview

SYCL 2020 provides very C-like interfaces for USM allocation/deallocations
routines. With in-order queues/USM and
link:./sycl_ext_oneapi_enqueue_functions.asciidoc[sycl_ext_oneapi_enqueue_functions]
as a future direction to write SYCL programs with as little overhead as possible
we need usability improvements for the USM APIs that C++ programmers would
expect.


== Specification

=== Feature test macro

This extension provides a feature-test macro as described in the core SYCL
specification.  An implementation supporting this extension must predefine the
macro `SYCL_EXT_ONEAPI_USM_RAII` to one of the values defined in
the table below.  Applications can test for the existence of this macro to
determine if the implementation supports this feature, or applications can test
the macro's value to determine which of the extension's features the
implementation supports.

|The APIs of this experimental extension are not versioned, so the
 feature-test macro always has this value.

=== USM Deleter

This extension adds `usm_deleter` helper that can be used with `std::unique_ptr`
or `std::shared_ptr` to manage deallocation of USM memory.

[source, c++]
----
namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental {

class usm_deleter {
public:
  usm_deleter(const context &Ctx);
  usm_deleter(const queue &q);

  template <typename T> void operator()(T *Ptr) const;
};
} // sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental
----

=== Example usage

A simple example of using this extension is below.

```c++
{
  sycl::queue q;
  using sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::usm_deleter;
  std::unique_ptr<int, usm_deleter> p{sycl::malloc_shared<int>(1, q), {q}};
  q.single_task([=, p = p.get()]() { *p = 42; }).wait();
}
```

== Issues/open questions/implementation details

* link:https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr/allocate_shared[`allocate_shared(const Alloc& alloc, Args&&... args )`]
  seems to work with existing `usm_allocator`. However, it uses single
  allocation for both the allocated object and auxilary data for
  `std::shared_ptr`. Having that auxilary data residing in the same USM memory
  might have unintended consequences depending on particular HW when copies are
  created on host when the same memory page is being accessed on a device.
* Providing `make_unique`/`make_shared`-like interface would lead to API bloat,
  so not explored in this revision.
* How should `usm_deleter` store `context`/`device`? Should it be another copy
  following SYCL's common reference semantics and, essentially, extending their
  lifetime for the duration of the smart pointer lifetime? Or can we require
  that the `usm_deleter` would only be called when the underlying
  `context`/`device` is still alive and as such it can simply store a reference
  to the underlying objects without having to pay the price of increasing
  use-counters to follow C++ approach of zero-cost abstractions comparing to
  manually calling `sycl::free`

This extension is written against the SYCL 2020 revision 4 specification. All
references below to the "core SYCL specification" or to section numbers in the
SYCL specification refer to that revision.

NOTE: This extension is experimental: interfaces are subject to change later.

== Introduction

This extension introduces an interface that enables a lazy execution and easy replay of a kernel graph by separating
Its definition and execution. 

== Feature test macro

This extension provides a feature-test macro as described in the core SYCL
specification section 6.3.3 "Feature test macros".  Therefore, an
implementation supporting this extension must predefine the macro
`SYCL_EXT_ONEAPI_GRAPH` to one of the values defined in the table below.
Applications can test for the existence of this macro to determine if the
implementation supports this feature, or applications can test the macro's
value to determine which of the extension's APIs the implementation supports.

Table 1. Values of the `SYCL_EXT_ONEAPI_GRAPH` macro.

|Value |Description
|1     |Initial extension version. Base features are supported.

== SYCL Graph Terminology

Table 2. Terminology.
|===
|Concept|Description
|graph| Class that stores structured work units and their dependencies
|node| The unit of work. Can have different attributes.
|edge| Dependency between work units. Happens before relation.
|===

== Node

Node is a class that encapsulates tasks like SYCL kernel functions or host tasks for deferred execution.
A graph has to be created first, the structure of a graph is defined second by adding nodes and edges.

[source,c++]
----
namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental {

  class node{
  };
}
----

NOTE:

== Edge

A dependency between two nodes representing a happens before relationship. `sender` and `receiver` may be accociated to different graphs.

[source,c++]
----
namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental {

	// Adding dependency between two nodes.
    	void make_edge(node sender, node receiver);
}
----

== Graph

Graph is a class that represents a directed acyclic graph of nodes. 
A graph can have different states, can be nested, can have multiple root nodes that are scheduled for execution first and multiple leaf nodes that are scheduled for execution last. The execution of a graph has been completed when all leaf node tasks have been completed.
Member functions as listed in Table 2 and 3 can be used to add nodes to a graph.

[source,c++]
----
namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental {

  enum class graph_state{
    modifiable,
    executable
  };

  template<graph_state State>
  class graph {
  public:
    operator graph<graph_state::executable>();
  };
  
  graph<graph_state::modifiable> make_graph();
  
  graph<graph_state::modifiable> compile(const graph<graph_state::executable> Graph);
  
}

sycl::event sycl::queue(const graph<graph_state::executable> Graph);

----

=== Executable Graph

A `graph` object in `graph_state::executable` represents a user generated device and context specific execution object that is submitted to a queue for execution.
The structure of such a `graph` object in this state is immutable and can not be changed, so are the tasks assigned with each node.
Support of submitting a graph for execution, before a previous execution has been completed is backend specific. The runtime may throw an error.

Table 3. Constructor of the `graph` class.
|===
|Constructor|Description

|`graph()`
|Creates a `graph` object. It's default state is `graph_state::modifiable`.

|===

Table 4. Member functions of the `graph` class.
|===
|Member function|Description

|`node add_node(const std::vector<node>& dep = {});`
|This creates an empty node which is associated to no task. It's intended use is either a connection point inside a graph between groups of nodes, and can significantly reduce the number of edges ( O(n) vs. O(n^2) ). Another use-case is building the structure of a graph first and adding tasks later.

|`template<typename T>
    	node add_node(T cgf, const std::vector<node>& dep = {});`
|This node captures a command group function object containing host task which is scheduled by the SYCL runtime or a SYCL function for invoking kernels with all restrictions that apply as described in the spec.

|===

Table 5. Member functions of the `graph` class (memory operations).
|===
|Member function|Description

|`node add_memcpy_node(void* dest, const void* src, size_t numBytes, const std::vector<node>& dep = {});`
|Adding a node that encapsulates a `memcpy` operation.

|`node add_memset_node(void* ptr, int value, size_t numBytes, const std::vector<node>& dep = {});`
|Adding a node that encapsulates a `memset` operation.

|`node add_malloc_node(void *data, size_t numBytes, usm::alloc kind, const std::vector<node>& dep = {});`
|Adding a node that encapsulates a `malloc` operation.

|`node add_free_node(void *data, const std::vector<node>& dep = {});`
|Adding a node that encapsulates a `free` operation.

|===


== Examples

NOTE: The examples below demonstrate intended usage of the extension, but are not compatible with the proof-of-concept implementation. The proof-of-concept implementation currently requires different syntax, as described in the "Non-implemented features" section at the end of this document.

1. Dot product

[source,c++]

#include <sycl/ext/oneapi/experimental/graph.hpp>

int main() {
  const size_t n = 10;
  float alpha = 1.0f;
  float beta = 2.0f;
  float gamma = 3.0f;

  sycl::queue q;

  auto g = sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::make_graph();

  float *x = sycl::malloc_shared<float>(n, q);
  float *y = sycl::malloc_shared<float>(n, q);
  float *z = sycl::malloc_shared<float>(n, q);

      [&](sycl::handler &h) {
        h.parallel_for(sycl::range<1>{n},
                       sycl::reduction(dotp, 0.0f, std::plus()),
                       [=](sycl::id<1> it, auto &sum) {
                         const size_t i = it[0];
                         sum += x[i] * z[i];
                       });
      },
      {node_a, node_b});

  auto exec = compile(q);

  q.submit(exec).wait();

  sycl::free(x, q);
  sycl::free(y, q);
  sycl::free(z, q);
  sycl::free(dotp, q);

  return 0;
}

== Issues for later investigations

. Explicit memory movement can cause POC to stall.

== Non-implemented features
Please, note that the following features are not yet implemented:

. Level Zero backend only
. Memory operation nodes not implemented
. Host node not implemented
. Submit overload of a queue. `submit(graph)` Use a combination of `executable_graph::exec_and_wait()` and queue property `sycl::ext::oneapi::property::queue::lazy_execution{}` instead.
. `class graph<graph_state>` Use dedicated `class graph` (equivalent to `graph_state == modifiable`) and `class executable_graph` (equivalent to `graph_state == executable`) instead.

== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SYCL 2020 revision 6 specification.  All
references below to the "core SYCL specification" or to section numbers in the
SYCL specification refer to that revision.


== Status

This is an experimental extension specification, intended to provide early
access to features and gather community feedback.  Interfaces defined in this
specification are implemented in {dpcpp}, but they are not finalized and may
change incompatibly in future versions of {dpcpp} without prior notice.
*Shipping software products should not rely on APIs defined in this
specification.*

== Backend support status

This extension is supported by all backends. However, as described in the following sections, this extension is currently only functionally useful in the `ext_oneapi_cuda` backend.


== Overview

When used with the `ext_oneapi_cuda` backend only, this extension exposes the https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#data-movement-and-conversion-instructions-ld-global-nc[ld-global-nc] ptx instruction so that users can load a register variable to the non-coherent read-only texture cache. The texture cache is designed for random access reads and is most performant when work-items within a sub-group read a set of addresses of texture memory that are close to one another in the cache. This extension introduces a free function, `ldg`, that is available for all backends and devices; however this function will only make use of a special hardware feature (The texture cache) when called from the `ext_oneapi_cuda` backend. The only reason that `ldg` is supported on backends other than `ext_oneapi_cuda` is to allow for code portability.

== Specification

=== Feature test macro

This extension provides a feature-test macro as described in the core SYCL
specification.  An implementation supporting this extension must predefine the
macro `SYCL_EXT_ONEAPI_CUDA_TEX_CACHE_READ` to one of the values defined in the table
below.  Applications can test for the existence of this macro to determine if
the implementation supports this feature, or applications can test the macro's
value to determine which of the extension's features the implementation
supports.

=== `ldg` free function

This extension adds a single templated free function which may be called from device
code. This function is not available in host code.

```
namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::cuda {

template<typename T>
T ldg(const T* ptr);

} // namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::cuda
```

`ldg` returns the data of type `T` located at address `ptr`. When called from the `ext_oneapi_cuda` backend the data is cached in the read-only texture cache.
When called from any other backend a copy of the data stored at address `ptr` is returned without using any special cache.

The template parameter `T` can be one of `float`, `vec<float, 2>`, `vec<float, 4>`, `double`, or `vec<double, 2>`.

=== Example of usage

```
    h.parallel_for<class kernel_name>(range, [=](sycl::nd_item<1> item) {
      const int idx = item.get_global_id(0);
      auto cachedA = sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::cuda::ldg(&A[idx]);
      auto cachedB = sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::cuda::ldg(&B[idx]);
      C[idx] = cachedA + cachedB;
    });
```

IMPORTANT: Data returned from `ldg`, e.g. `cacheA` and `cacheB` in the above example, should not be written to at any point within the kernel. If such data is written to at any point in the kernel, the code will compile and execute correctly, however the texture cache will not be used. Sometimes the compiler may not be sure that the read-only condition is satisfied. In such cases users can mark the declaration of the pointer used as the argument to `ldg` with both the `const` and `$$__$$restrict$$__$$` qualifiers, which may aid the compiler in detecting the read-only condition.

=== Issues

- Investigate exposing this functionality through annotated_ptr once the sycl_ext_oneapi_annotated_ptr becomes finalized.
- Add `half`, `bfloat16` and integer cases. These cases require some additional work, and so won't be included in the initial implementation.

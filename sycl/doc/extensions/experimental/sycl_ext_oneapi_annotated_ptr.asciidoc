== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SYCL 2020 revision 5 specification.  All
references below to the "core SYCL specification" or to section numbers in the
SYCL specification refer to that revision.

This extension also depends on the following other SYCL extensions:

* link:../experimental/sycl_ext_oneapi_properties.asciidoc[sycl_ext_oneapi_properties]
extension.

== Status

This is an experimental extension specification, intended to provide early
access to features and gather community feedback.  Interfaces defined in this
specification are implemented in {dpcpp}, but they are not finalized and may
change incompatibly in future versions of {dpcpp} without prior notice.
*Shipping software products should not rely on APIs defined in this
specification.*

== Overview

This extension introduces a pointer wrapper class that provides a mechanism to
attach compile-time constant information to a pointer in a manner that allows
the compiler to reliably maintain and analyze the information.

[NOTE]
====
In this document, we use the shortened form `annotated_ptr` to refer to the
proposed `sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::annotated_ptr` class.
====

The purpose of this document is to clearly describe and specify `annotated_ptr`
and related concepts, types, and mechanisms, and to give examples and context
for their usage.

== Specification

=== Feature test macro

This extension provides a feature-test macro as described in the core SYCL
specification, Section 6.3.3 "Feature test macros". Therefore, an
implementation supporting this extension must predefine the macro
`SYCL_EXT_ONEAPI_ANNOTATED_PTR` to one of the values defined in the table below.
Applications can test for the existence of this macro to determine if the
implementation supports this feature, or applications can test the macro's
value to determine which of the extension's features
that the implementation supports.

=== Motivation

When compiling a program with pointer operations, it is often desirable to
attach certain information such as optimization hints or functional directives
onto the pointer itself.

Any acceptable mechanism to attach such information should meet the following
requirements:

  1. It should not be burdensome for users to use the mechanism.
  2. It should be reasonably scalable and not add significant burden on compiler
  developers to maintain the mechanism.
  3. It should preserve the attached information through most uses of the
  pointer.

For example, consider the following case: We want to specify some compile-time
constant information `I` for a pointer. One possible method to do so is for the
compiler to provide a special function for reading to and writing from the
pointer and have this function convey `I` to the compiler at the call site where
the read or write occurs.

That is, users would convert code that looks like:
```c++
{
  SomeType* a;
  ...
  *a = some_val;
  ...
  read_val = *a
}
```

To code that looks like:
```c++
{
  SomeType* a;
  ...
  __special_store_with_annotation(a, some_val,
    I /*some compile time constant information*/);
  ...
  __special_load_with_annotation(a, &read_val,
    I /*some compile time constant information*/);
}
```

This mechanism does not meet requirement (1) listed above because users have to
replace all their pointer read/write code with special function calls.

Another mechanism could be that the compiler provides attributes which can be
applied to the pointer declaration to convey some compile-time constant
information. In this case users would change their code to:
```cpp
{
  // 'I' is the compiler time constant information being annotated on 'a'
  [[special_annotations::use_case_x_attribute(I)]] SomeType* a;
  ...
  *a = some_val;
  ...
  read_val = *a
}
```
However, this mechanism fails to meet requirements (2) and (3) listed above
since:

  * Adding new attributes can add non-trivial attribute creation overheads for
  compiler developers. With growing set of attributes, there is an associated
  burden of maintaining them and of preparing diagnostic checks.
  * Compilers are not required to preserve information propagated as attributes.
  Hence this method is only suitable for hints, and not functional directives.
  Further, from a given load/store call a compiler may not be able to
  successfully trace back to the declaration to deduce which annotation was
  applied to it.

The `annotated_ptr` class described in this document is a class template that
encapsulates a pointer. The template accepts a list of compile-time constant
properties. The implementation of the class defined here should preserve the
information provided as compile-time constant properties through all uses of the
pointer unless noted otherwise.

.Unsupported Usage Example
[source,c++]
----
using sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental;
struct MyType {
  MyType(const MyType& otherM) {
     ...
  }
};

struct MyKernel {
  annotated_ptr<MyType, properties<PropA>> a; //non-trivially-copyable type is not allowed
  annotated_ptr<void, properties<PropB>> b;   //void is legal 
  ...
  void operator()() const {
    ...
    *b = ...; //deference is not allowed
  }
};
----
It is ill-formed to instantiate`annotated_ptr` and `annotated_ref` for a non-trivially-copyable
type `T`. The only exception is that `annotated_ptr` is allowed to be instantiated with `void`.

In the above example, encapsulating `annotated_ptr` within `MyType` is illegal. Encapsulating
`annotated_ptr` with `void` is legal, but it can not be deferenced.

[source,c++]
----
using sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental;
struct MyType {
  annotated_ptr<int, properties<PropC>> a;
  annotated_ptr<int, properties<PropD>> b;
};

struct MyKernel {
  MyType arg_a;
  MyType arg_b;
  ...
  void operator()() const {
    ...
  }
};
----
It is illegal to apply `annotated_ptr` to members of kernel arguments. In the
above example, encapsulating `annotated_ptr` within `MyType` is illegal.

=== Representation of `annotated_ptr`

`annotated_ptr` is a class template, parameterized by the type of the underlying
allocation `T`, and a list of properties `PropertyListT`.

[source,c++]
----
namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental {
template <typename T, typename PropertyListT = empty_properties_t>
class annotated_ptr {
  ...
----

`PropertyListT` enables properties to be associated with an `annotated_ptr`.
Properties may be specified for an `annotated_ptr` to provide semantic
modification or optimization hint information. Please note that there cannot
be duplicated property in a properties list. Otherwise, a compiler time error is triggered.

Here's an example of how a property could be used:

[source,c++]
----
using namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental;
{
  sycl::queue q;
  int* ptr = ...
  // alignment of the pointer in bytes specified using the property 'alignment'
  auto arg_a = annotated_ptr(ptr, properties{alignment<4>});

  // alignment in bytes and address bus width of the pointer specified using the
  // properties 'alignment' and 'awidth'.
  // a properties object is deduced from the list the of property values
  auto arg_b = annotated_ptr(ptr, alignment<4>, awidth<32>);

  q.submit([=]{
    ...
    *arg_a = (*arg_a) * 2;
  });
  ...
}
----

The section below and the table that follows, describe the constructors and
member functions for `annotated_ptr`.

NOTE: `annotated_ptr` is a trivially copyable type.

The section below refers to an `annotated_ref` class which is described in the
section following this one.

=== Add new reference wrapper class `annotated_ref` to enable `annotated_ptr`

The purpose of the `annotated_ref` class template is to provide reference
wrapper semantics. It enables properties to be preserved on loads from and
stores to annotated_ptrs.

```c++
namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental {
template <typename T, typename PropertyListT = empty_properties_t>
class annotated_ref {
  public:
    annotated_ref(const annotated_ref&) = delete;
    operator T() const;

    template <typename O>         //available only if O is not an annotated_ref type
    T operator=(O&&) const;
    T operator=(const annotated_ref&) const;

    // OP is: +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, <<=, >>=, &=, |=, ^=
    template <typename O>         //available only if O is not an annotated_ref type
    T operatorOP(O&& a) const;
    T operatorOP(const annotated_ref &b) const;

    T operator++() const;
    T operator++(int) const;
    T operator--() const;
    T operator--(int) const;

    // OP is: +, -, *, /, %, <<, >>, &, |, ^, <, <=, >, >=, ==, ~=, &&, ||
    template <typename O>
    auto friend operatorOP(O&& a, const annotated_ref& b) ->
               decltype(std::forward<O>(a) OP std::declval<T>());
    template <typename O>         //available only if O is not an annotated_ref type
    auto friend operatorOP(const annotated_ref& a, O&& b) ->
               decltype(std::declval<T>() OP std::forward<O>(b));

    // OP is: +, -, !, ~

== Issues related to `annotated_ptr`

1) [RESOLVED] Should we allow implicit conversion to base class by default?

No, implicit conversion will not be allowed.

2) [RESOLVED] How do we support `operator->`?

We will not support `operator->` with the initial release, since we do
not have meaningful usecases that require this support. Building the support
is complicated

3) [RESOLVED] Can `sycl::atomic_ref` be used with `annotated_ref`?

`atomic_ref` will not work with `annotated_ref` as is since `atomic_ref`
restricts the types it can take. If we want, we can create a sycl extension for
`atomic_ref` to support `annotated_ref`. The implementation complexity will
depend on how we chose to implement `annotated_ref`: via builtins or via pointer
annotations.

4) [RESOLVED] Should we provide conversion functions to convert to/from
multi_ptr?

No we do not want to support multi_ptr conversion. 'multi_ptr's provide
a way to annotate address spaces. That can be built with annotated_ptr.

5) We need a property to capture local, global or private address-spaces. Within
global space we may want to distinguish between general, host, and device memory
spaces.

6) [RESOLVED] Ctor should clarify whether when constructing the object from two
different property lists, duplicates will exist or not.

Updated ctor description with the resolution.

7) Add `runtime_aligned` property back to this core spec once a way to query
the alignment is set up.

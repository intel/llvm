https://github.com/intel/llvm/issues


== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SYCL 2020 revision 8 specification.
All references below to the "core SYCL specification" or to section numbers in
the SYCL specification refer to that revision.


== Status

This is an experimental extension specification, intended to provide early
access to features and gather community feedback.
Interfaces defined in this specification are implemented in {dpcpp}, but they
are not finalized and may change incompatibly in future versions of {dpcpp}
without prior notice.
*Shipping software products should not rely on APIs defined in this
specification.*

There are important limitations with the {dpcpp} implementation of this
experimental extension.
In particular, some parts of this extension may only be used when the
application is compiled in AOT mode.
See the section below titled "Limitations with the experimental version" for a
full description of the limitations.


== Overview

This extension provides a way for device code to query the device architecture
on which it is running.
This is similar to the
link:../proposed/sycl_ext_oneapi_device_if.asciidoc[sycl_ext_oneapi_device_if]
extension except the comparison is for the device's architecture not the
device's aspects.
In some cases, low-level application code can use special features or do
specific optimizations depending on the device architecture, and this extension
enables such applications.


== Specification

=== Feature test macro

This extension provides a feature-test macro as described in the core SYCL
specification.
An implementation supporting this extension must predefine the macro
`SYCL_EXT_ONEAPI_DEVICE_ARCHITECTURE` to one of the values defined in the table
below.
Applications can test for the existence of this macro to determine if the
implementation supports this feature, or applications can test the macro's
value to determine which of the extension's features the implementation
supports.

[%header,cols="1,5"]
|===
|Value
|Description

|1
|The APIs of this experimental extension are not versioned, so the
 feature-test macro always has this value.
|===

=== New enumeration of architectures

This extension adds a new enumeration of the architectures that can be tested.

|===

The enumerators are guaranteed to be partially ordered, which means that some
comparison operations (e.g. `<`, `>`) are meaningful.
Specifically, the following guarantees are provided:

* When an enumerator's value is defined in the table above as equal to some
  other enumerator, the values of the two enumerators are guaranteed to be the
  same.

* The enumerators within a "family" (e.g. the Intel GPU family) are guaranteed
  to have ascending values in the order that they are defined in the table
  above.
  (Except, of course, for the enumerators that are defined to have a value that
  is equal to some other enumerator.)

Enumerators from different families have no guaranteed relative order.

[_Note:_ An "alias" enumerator is generally added for new Intel GPU devices
only after hardware has finalized and the exact version is known.
_{endnote}_]

[_Note:_
For NVIDIA GPUs, the architecture enumerator corresponds to the
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#compute-capabilities[compute capability]
of the device, and `if_architecture_is` can be used similarly to the
`+__CUDA_ARCH__+` macro in CUDA.

!====

_Constraints:_ The type `T` must be a {cpp} `Callable` type which is invocable
with an empty parameter list.

_Mandates (7):_ The architecture `Arch1` must be in the same family as `Arch2`.

_Preconditions:_ This function must be called from device code.

_Effects:_ The template parameters to these functions identify a condition that
gates execution of the callable object `fn`.
If the condition is `true`, the object `fn` is called.
Otherwise, the function `fn` is potentially discarded as described in the
link:../proposed/sycl_ext_oneapi_device_if.asciidoc[sycl_ext_oneapi_device_if]
extension.

For (1), the condition is `true` only if the device which executes the
`if_architecture_is` function has any one of the architectures listed in the
`Archs` pack.

For (2), the condition is `true` only if the device which executes the
`if_architecture_is` function has an architecture that is in any one of the
categories listed in the `Categories` pack.

For (3), the condition is `true` only if the device which executes the
`if_architecture_is_lt` function has an architecture that is in the same
family as `Arch` and compares less than `Arch`.

For (4), the condition is `true` only if the device which executes the
`if_architecture_is_le` function has an architecture that is in the same
family as `Arch` and compares less than or equal to `Arch`.

For (5), the condition is `true` only if the device which executes the
`if_architecture_is_gt` function has an architecture that is in the same
family as `Arch` and compares greater than `Arch`.

For (6), the condition is `true` only if the device which executes the
`if_architecture_is_ge` function has an architecture that is in the same
family as `Arch` and compares greater than or equal to `Arch`.

For (7), the condition is `true` only if the device which executes the
`if_architecture_is_between` function has an architecture that is in the same
family as `Arch1` and is greater than or equal to `Arch1` and is less than or
equal to `Arch2`.

_Returns:_ An object _F_ of the unnamed "else" class, which can be used to
perform if-then-else chains.
|====

=== The unnamed "else" class

Some functions in this extension return an object _F_ of the unnamed "else"
class, allowing applications to perform if-then-else chains.

_Effects:_ This function has an associated condition that gates execution of
the callable object `fn`.
This condition is `true` only if the object _F_ comes from a previous call
whose associated condition is `false`.
Otherwise, the function `fn` is potentially discarded as described in the

== Limitations with the experimental version

The {dpcpp} implementation of this extension currently has some important
limitations with the `if_architecture_is` free function.
In order to use this feature, the application must be compiled in ahead-of-time
(AOT) mode using `-fsycl-targets=<special-target>` where `<special-target>` is
one of the "special target values" listed in the
link:../../UsersManual.md[users manual] description of the `-fsycl-targets`
option.
These are the target names of the form "intel_gpu_*", "nvidia_gpu_*", or
"amd_gpu_*".

The architecture enumerations `intel_cpu_spr` and `intel_cpu_gnr` do
not currently work with any of the APIs described in this extension.
They cannot be used with the `if_architecture_is` function, the
`device::ext_oneapi_architecture_is` function, or the
`info::device::architecture` query descriptor.
They currently exist only for use with the
link:sycl_ext_matrix/sycl_ext_oneapi_matrix.asciidoc[sycl_ext_oneapi_matrix]
extension.


== Implementation notes

Some planning is required when choosing the values for the `architecture`
enumerators because applications will expect comparisons to reflect the
features that are available.
For example, an application might assume that
`arch >= architecture::intel_gpu_pvc` tests for an Intel GPU that is PVC or
newer.
For the Intel GPUs, the order of the enumerators should be the same as the
order of the device's 32-bit GMDID values.
One solution is to use the GMDID value as the value of the enumerator, but we
must ensure that the value does not accidentally collide with a value from
another architecture family.
We could potentially use the top bits to distinguish between architecture
families, but this could cause problems if future GMDID values start using
those top bits.
Another option is to use a 64-bit base type for the enumeration.
Whatever strategy we choose, we should not need to renumber the enumerators
whenever a new one is added because this would constitute an ABI break.


== Future direction

This experimental extension is still evolving.
We expect that future versions will include the following:

* A compile-time constant property that can be used to decorate kernels and
  non-kernel device functions:
+
--
[source]
----
namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental {

struct device_architecture_is_key {
  template <architecture... Archs>
  using value_t = property_value<device_architecture_is_key,
    std::integral_constant<architecture, Archs>...>;
};

template <architecture... Archs>
struct property_value<device_architecture_is_key,
  std::integral_constant<architecture, Archs>...>
{
  static constexpr std::array<architecture, sizeof...(Archs)> value;
};

template <architecture... Archs>
inline constexpr device_architecture_is_key::value_t<Archs...>
  device_architecture_is;

} // namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental
----

This property indicates that a kernel or non-kernel device function uses
features that are available on devices with the given architecture list but may
not be available on devices with other architectures.
--

* Additional enumerators in the `architecture` and `arch_category`
  enumerations.
  This could include entries for different x86_64 architectures.

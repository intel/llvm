== Status

Working Draft

This is a preview extension specification, intended to provide early access to a feature for review and community feedback. When the feature matures, this specification may be released as a formal extension.

Because the interfaces defined by this specification are not final and are subject to change they are not intended to be used by shipping software products.

== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SYCL 1.2.1 specification, Revision 6.

== Overview

A sub-group represents an implementation-defined grouping of work-items in a work-group. The work-items within a sub-group can communicate and synchronize independently of work-items in other sub-groups, and sub-groups are therefore commonly mapped to SIMD hardware where it exists.

The first version of this document is focused on exposing sub-group functionality to the NDRange form of SYCL +parallel_for+, and does not address hierarchical parallelism.

=== Towards a Generic Group Abstraction

Providing a generic group abstraction encapsulating the shared functionality of all synchronizable SYCL groups (i.e. work-groups and sub-groups) in a single interface would enable users to write more general code and simplify the introduction of additional SYCL groups in the future (e.g. device-wide synchronization groups).  Some names in this proposal are chosen to demonstrate how this may look:

- The common interface members of +sub_group+ do not reference sub-groups by name, opting instead for generic names like +get_group_range()+.
- +sub_group+ defines a number of types and static members to simplify writing generic code.

=== Attributes

The +[[intel::reqd_sub_group_size(n)]]+ attribute indicates that the kernel must be compiled and executed with a sub-group of size _n_.  The value of _n_ must be set to a sub-group size that is both supported by the device and compatible with all language features used by the kernel, or device compilation will fail.  The set of valid sub-group sizes can be queried as described below.

In addition to device functions, the required sub-group size attribute may also be specified in the definition of a named functor object, as in the example below:

[source, c++]
----
class Functor
{
  void operator()(item<1> item) [[intel::reqd_sub_group_size(16)]]
  {
    /* kernel code */
  }
}
----

It is illegal for a kernel or function to call a function with a mismatched sub-group size requirement, and the compiler should produce an error in this case.  The +reqd_sub_group_size+ attribute is not propagated from a device function to callers of the function, and must be specified explicitly when a kernel is defined.

=== Sub-group Queries

Several aspects of sub-group functionality are implementation-defined: the size and number of sub-groups is implementation-defined (and may differ for each kernel); and different devices may make different guarantees with respect to how sub-groups within a work-group are scheduled.  Developers can query these behaviors at a device level and for individual kernels.  The sub-group size for a given combination of kernel and launch configuration is fixed, and guaranteed to be reflected by device and kernel queries.

Each sub-group in a work-group is one-dimensional.  If the total number of work-items in a work-group is evenly divisible by the sub-group size, all sub-groups in the work-group will contain the same number of work-items.  If the total number of work-items in a work-group is not evenly divisible by the sub-group size, the number of work-items in the final sub-group is equal to the remainder of the total work-group size divided by the sub-group size.

To maximize portability across devices, developers should not assume that work-items within a sub-group execute in lockstep, nor that two sub-groups within a work-group will make independent forward progress with respect to one another.

The device descriptors below are added to the +info::device+ enumeration class:

|===
|Device Descriptors|Return Type|Description

|+info::device::max_num_sub_groups+
|+uint32_t+
|Returns the maximum number of sub-groups in a work-group for any kernel executed on the device.  The minimum value is 1.

|+info::device::sub_group_independent_forward_progress+
|+bool+
|Returns +true+ if the device supports independent forward progress of sub-groups with respect to other sub-groups in the same work-group.

|+info::device::sub_group_sizes+
|+vector_class<size_t>+
|Returns a vector_class of +size_t+ containing the set of sub-group sizes supported by the device.
|===

An additional query for sub-group information is added to the +kernel+ class:

|===
|Member Functions|Description

|+template <info::kernel_sub_group param>typename info::param_traits<info::kernel_sub_group, param>::return_type get_sub_group_info(const device &dev) const+
|Query information from the sub-group from a kernel using the +info::kernel_sub_group+ descriptor for a specific device.
|===

The kernel descriptors below are added as part of a new +info::kernel_sub_group+ enumeration class:

|===
|Kernel Descriptors|Return Type|Description

|+info::kernel_sub_group::max_num_sub_groups+
|+uint32_t+
|Returns the maximum number of sub-groups for this kernel.

|+info::kernel_sub_group::compile_num_sub_groups+
|+uint32_t+
|Returns the number of sub-groups specified by the kernel, or 0 (if not specified).

|+info::kernel_sub_group::max_sub_group_size+
|+uint32_t+
|Returns the maximum sub-group size for this kernel.

|+info::kernel_sub_group::compile_sub_group_size+
|+uint32_t+
|Returns the required sub-group size specified by the kernel, or 0 (if not specified).
|===

=== The sub_group Class

The +sub_group+ class encapsulates all functionality required to represent a particular sub-group within a parallel execution.  It has common by-value semantics and is not default or user-constructible, and can only be accessed in ND-range kernels.

To provide access to the +sub_group+ class, a new member function is added to the +nd_item+ class:

|===
|Member Functions|Description

|+sub_group get_sub_group() const+
|Return the sub-group to which the work-item belongs.
|===

The member functions of the sub-group class provide a mechanism for a developer to query properties of a sub-group and a work-item's position in it.

|===
|Member Functions|Description

|+id<1> get_local_id() const+
|Return an +id+ representing the index of the work-item within the sub-group.

|+uint32_t get_linear_local_id() const+
|Return a +uint32_t+ representing the index of the work-item within the sub-group.

|+range<1> get_local_range() const+
|Return a SYCL +range+ representing the number of work-items in the sub-group.

|+range<1> get_max_local_range() const+
|Return a SYCL +range+ representing the maximum number of work-items in any sub-group within the nd-range.

|+id<1> get_group_id() const+
|Return an +id+ representing the index of the sub-group within the work-group.

|+uint32_t get_linear_group_id() const+
|Return a +uint32_t+ representing the index of the sub-group within the work-group.

|+range<1> get_group_range() const+
|Return a SYCL +range+ representing the number of sub-groups within the work-group.

|+range<1> get_max_group_range() const+
|Return a SYCL +range+ representing the maximum number of sub-groups per work-group within the nd-range.
|===

An example usage of the +sub_group+ class is given below:

[source, c++]
----
parallel_for<class kernel>(..., [&](nd_item item)
{
  sub_group sg = item.get_sub_group();
  for (int v = sg.get_local_id(); v < N; v += sg.get_local_range())
  {
    ...
  }
});

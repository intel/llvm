== Status

Working Draft

This is a preview extension specification, intended to provide early access to a feature for review and community feedback. When the feature matures, this specification may be released as a formal extension.

Because the interfaces defined by this specification are not final and are subject to change they are not intended to be used by shipping software products.

== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SYCL 1.2.1 specification, Revision 6 and the SYCL_INTEL_device_specific_kernel_queries extension.

== Overview

A sub-group represents an implementation-defined grouping of work-items in a work-group. The work-items within a sub-group can communicate and synchronize independently of work-items in other sub-groups, and sub-groups are therefore commonly mapped to SIMD hardware where it exists.

The first version of this document is focused on exposing sub-group functionality to the NDRange form of SYCL +parallel_for+, and does not address hierarchical parallelism.

=== Towards a Generic Group Abstraction

Providing a generic group abstraction encapsulating the shared functionality of all synchronizable SYCL groups (i.e. work-groups and sub-groups) in a single interface would enable users to write more general code and simplify the introduction of additional SYCL groups in the future (e.g. device-wide synchronization groups).  Some names in this proposal are chosen to demonstrate how this may look:

- The common interface members of +sub_group+ do not reference sub-groups by name, opting instead for generic names like +get_group_range()+.
- +sub_group+ defines a number of types and static members to simplify writing generic code.

=== Attributes

The +[[intel::reqd_sub_group_size(n)]]+ attribute indicates that the kernel must be compiled and executed with a sub-group of size _n_.  The value of _n_ must be a compile-time integral constant expression.  The value of _n_ must be set to a sub-group size that is both supported by the device and compatible with all language features used by the kernel, or device compilation will fail.  The set of valid sub-group sizes can be queried as described below.

In addition to device functions, the required sub-group size attribute may also be specified in the definition of a named functor object, as in the example below:

[source, c++]
----
class Functor
{
  void operator()(item<1> item) [[intel::reqd_sub_group_size(16)]]
  {
    /* kernel code */
  }
}
----

It is illegal for a kernel or function to call a function with a mismatched sub-group size requirement, and the compiler should produce an error in this case.  The +reqd_sub_group_size+ attribute is not propagated from a device function to callers of the function, and must be specified explicitly when a kernel is defined.

=== Sub-group Queries

Several aspects of sub-group functionality are implementation-defined: the size and number of sub-groups is implementation-defined (and may differ for each kernel); and different devices may make different guarantees with respect to how sub-groups within a work-group are scheduled.  Developers can query these behaviors at a device level and for individual kernels.  The sub-group size for a given combination of kernel and launch configuration is fixed, and guaranteed to be reflected by device and kernel queries.

Each sub-group in a work-group is one-dimensional.  If the total number of work-items in a work-group is evenly divisible by the sub-group size, all sub-groups in the work-group will contain the same number of work-items.  If the total number of work-items in a work-group is not evenly divisible by the sub-group size, the number of work-items in the final sub-group is equal to the remainder of the total work-group size divided by the sub-group size.

To maximize portability across devices, developers should not assume that work-items within a sub-group execute in lockstep, nor that two sub-groups within a work-group will make independent forward progress with respect to one another.

The device descriptors below are added to the +info::device+ enumeration class:

|===
|Device Descriptors|Return Type|Description

|+info::device::max_num_sub_groups+
|+uint32_t+
|Returns the maximum number of sub-groups in a work-group for any kernel executed on the device.  The minimum value is 1.

|+info::device::sub_group_independent_forward_progress+
|+bool+
|Returns +true+ if the device supports independent forward progress of sub-groups with respect to other sub-groups in the same work-group.

|+info::device::sub_group_sizes+
|+vector_class<size_t>+
|Returns a vector_class of +size_t+ containing the set of sub-group sizes supported by the device.
|===

An additional query is added to the +kernel+ class, enabling an input value to be passed to `get_info`.  The original `get_info` query from the SYCL_INTEL_device_specific_kernel_queries extension should be used for queries that do not specify an input type.

|===
|Member Functions|Description

|+template <info::kernel_device_specific param>typename info::param_traits<info::kernel_device_specific, param>::return_type get_info(const device &dev, typename info::param_traits<info::kernel_device_specific, param>::input_type value) const+
|Query information from a kernel using the +info::kernel_device_specific+ descriptor for a specific device and input parameter.  The expected value of the input parameter depends on the information being queried.
|===

The kernel descriptors below are added to the +info::kernel_device_specific+ enumeration class:

|===
|Kernel Descriptors|Input Type|Return Type|Description

|+info::kernel_device_specific::max_num_sub_groups+
|N/A
|+uint32_t+
|Returns the maximum number of sub-groups for this kernel.

|+info::kernel_device_specific::compile_num_sub_groups+
|N/A
|+uint32_t+
|Returns the number of sub-groups specified by the kernel, or 0 (if not specified).

|+info::kernel_device_specific::max_sub_group_size+
|+range<D>+
|+uint32_t+
|Returns the maximum sub-group size for this kernel launched with the specified work-group size.

|+info::kernel_device_specific::compile_sub_group_size+
|N/A
|+uint32_t+
|Returns the required sub-group size specified by the kernel, or 0 (if not specified).
|===

=== The sub_group Class

The +sub_group+ class encapsulates all functionality required to represent a particular sub-group within a parallel execution.  It has common by-value semantics and is not default or user-constructible, and can only be accessed in ND-range kernels.

To provide access to the +sub_group+ class, a new member function is added to the +nd_item+ class:

|===
|Member Functions|Description

|+sub_group get_sub_group() const+
|Return the sub-group to which the work-item belongs.
|===

==== Core Member Functions

The core member functions of the sub-group class provide a mechanism for a developer to query properties of a sub-group and a work-item's position in it.

|===
|Member Functions|Description

|+id<1> get_local_id() const+
|Return an +id+ representing the index of the work-item within the sub-group.

|+uint32_t get_linear_local_id() const+
|Return a +uint32_t+ representing the index of the work-item within the sub-group.

|+range<1> get_local_range() const+
|Return a SYCL +range+ representing the number of work-items in the sub-group.

|+range<1> get_max_local_range() const+
|Return a SYCL +range+ representing the maximum number of work-items in any sub-group within the nd-range.

|+id<1> get_group_id() const+
|Return an +id+ representing the index of the sub-group within the work-group.

|+uint32_t get_linear_group_id() const+
|Return a +uint32_t+ representing the index of the sub-group within the work-group.

|+range<1> get_group_range() const+
|Return a SYCL +range+ representing the number of sub-groups within the work-group.

|+range<1> get_max_group_range() const+
|Return a SYCL +range+ representing the maximum number of sub-groups per work-group within the nd-range.
|===

An example usage of the +sub_group+ class is given below:

[source, c++]
----
parallel_for<class kernel>(..., [&](nd_item item)
{
  sub_group sg = item.get_sub_group();
  for (int v = sg.get_local_id(); v < N; v += sg.get_local_range())
  {
    ...
  }
});
----

==== Synchronization Functions

A sub-group barrier synchronizes all work-items in a sub-group, and orders memory operations with a memory fence to all address spaces.

|===
|Member Functions|Description

|+void barrier() const+
|Execute a sub-group barrier.
|===

==== Shuffles

The shuffle sub-group functions perform arbitrary communication between pairs of work-items in a sub-group.  Common patterns -- such as shifting all values in a sub-group by a fixed number of work-items -- are exposed as specialized shuffles that may be accelerated in hardware.

|===
|Member Functions|Description

|+template <typename T> T shuffle(T x, id<1> local_id) const+
|Exchange values of _x_ between work-items in the sub-group in an arbitrary pattern.  Returns the value of _x_ from the work-item with the specified id.  The value of _local_id_ must be between 0 and the sub-group size.

|+template <typename T> T shuffle_down(T x, uint32_t delta) const+
|Exchange values of _x_ between work-items in the sub-group via a shift.  Returns the value of _x_ from the work-item whose id is _delta_ larger than the calling work-item. The value returned when the result of id + _delta_ is greater than or equal to the sub-group size is undefined.

|+template <typename T> T shuffle_up(T x, uint32_t delta) const+
|Exchange values of _x_ between work-items in the sub-group via a shift.  Returns the value of _x_ from the work-item whose id is _delta_ smaller than the calling work-item. The value of returned when the result of id - _delta_ is less than zero is undefined.

|+template <typename T> T shuffle_xor(T x, id<1> mask) const+
|Exchange pairs of values of _x_ between work-items in the sub-group.  Returns the value of _x_ from the work-item whose id is equal to the exclusive-or of the calling work-item's id and _mask_. _mask_ must be a compile-time constant value that is the same for all work-items in the sub-group.
|===

== Issues

. Should sub-group query results for specific kernels depend on work-group size?
+
--
*RESOLVED*:
Yes, this is required by OpenCL devices.  Devices that do not require the work-group size can ignore the parameter.
--

. Should sub-group "shuffles" be member functions?
+
--
*RESOLVED*:
Yes, the four shuffles in this extension are a defining feature of sub-groups.  Higher-level algorithms (such as those in the +SubGroupAlgorithms+ proposal) may build on them, the same way as higher-level algorithms using work-groups build on work-group local memory.

== Introduction
This document describes an extension that introduces a +sycl::ext::oneapi::property::buffer::use_pinned_host_memory+ property for the `sycl::buffer`.  Some SYCL backends can accelerate copies between host and device by allocating pinned memory.  The property can be passed to the `sycl::buffer` constructor in order to enable such an allocation.

|Property |Description
|`syc::ext::oneapi::property::buffer::use_pinned_host_memory`
| The `use_pinned_host_memory` property adds the requirement that the SYCL runtime must allocate host pinned memory for the `sycl::buffer`. The property cannot be used with the `sycl::buffer` constructors that take hostData parameter, an invalid_object_error SYCL exception must be thrown in this case.

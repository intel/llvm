== Introduction
This document presents an extension on top of the SYCL specification.  The goal of this extension is to provide a new device selector class that allows expressing common but non-trivial requirements for device selection in a simple manner.

== Filter Selector

The filter selector is a new device selector class that accepts a string of one or more filters that refine the set of devices that may be returned when the selector's `select_device` method is invoked.  Devices that match the specified filter(s) are ranked by the `default_selector` to determine which device is ultimately selected.  The `default_selector` is used to prefer an implementation's preferences for one device over another when multiple devices satisfy the provided filters.

=== DSL for Specifying Filters

A string passed to the selector defines one or more filters.  Filters have a certain syntax that must be followed.  A filter is specified as a triple of the form:

[source]
--
Backend:DeviceType:RelativeDeviceNumber
--

Every element of the triple is optional, but a filter must contain at least one component. 

`Backend` specifies the desired backend for the wanted devices. `DeviceType` specifies the type of the desired device.  `RelativeDeviceNumber` refers to the number of device that matches any other requirements, starting from `0`, which means "the first device that matches the requirements".  Incorrect input will result in an a `runtime_error` being thrown.

.Supported Backends
[width=25%]
|====
| Backend

|`cuda`
|`host`
| `opencl`
|`level_zero`
|====

.Supported Device Types
[width=25%]
|====
| Device Type

| `accelerator`
| `cpu`
| `gpu`
| `host`
|====

=== Specifying Multiple Filters

Multiple filters may be specified in the string passed to the selector by using `,` to separate additional filters.

[source]
--
Backend0:DeviceType0:RelativeDeviceNumber0,Backend1:DeviceType1:RelativeDeviceNumber1,...
--

== Examples

[source,c++]
----

// Return a device that uses the opencl backend
filter_selector("opencl")

// Return a cpu device that uses the opencl backend
filter_selector("opencl:cpu")

// Return a gpu device
filter_selector("gpu")

// Return the first device found
filter_selector("0")

// Return the second opencl gpu found
filter_selector("opencl:gpu:1")

// Return either a gpu or cpu
filter_selector("gpu,cpu")

// Return either a cuda gpu or an opencl cpu
filter_selector("cuda:gpu,opencl:cpu")

// Return either the second level_zero gpu or the host device
filter_selector("level_zero:gpu:1,host")

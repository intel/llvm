== Introduction
IMPORTANT: This specification is a draft.

NOTE: Khronos(R) is a registered trademark and SYCL(TM) is a trademark of the Khronos Group, Inc.

CAUTION: This document is better viewed when rendered as html with asciidoctor.  GitHub does not render image icons.

This document presents a series of changes proposed for a future version of the SYCL Specification.  The goal of these proposals is to reduce the complexity and verbosity of using SYCL for programmers.  These proposals also seek to reduce the barrier to integrate SYCL code into existing C++ codebases by introducing new modes that reduce the amount of code that must be changed to interface the two codes.

== SYCL Memory Management
This section describes new properties and routines for pointer-based memory management interfaces in SYCL.  These routines augment, rather than replace, the existing buffer-based interfaces in SYCL 1.2.1.  

=== Unified Addressing
Unified Addressing guarantees that all devices will use a unified address space.  Pointer values in the unified address space will always refer to the same location in memory.  The unified address space encompasses the host and one or more devices.  Note that this does not require addresses in the unified address space to be accessible on all devices, just that pointer values will be consistent.

=== Unified Shared Memory
Unified Shared Memory (USM) is a capability that, when available, provides the ability to create allocations that are visible to both host and device(s).  USM builds upon Unified Addressing to define a shared address space where pointer values in this space always refer to the same location in memory.  USM defines multiple tiers of increasing capability described in the following sections:

 * Explicit USM
 * Restricted USM
 * Concurrent USM
 * System USM

NOTE: All utility functions described below are located in the `sycl` namespace unless otherwise indicated.

==== Explicit USM
Explicit USM defines capabilities for explicitly managing device memory.  Programmers directly allocate device memory, and data must be explicitly copied between the host and a device.  Device allocations are obtained through a SYCL device allocator instead of the system allocator.  Device allocations are not accessible on the host, but the pointer values remain consistent on account of Unified Addressing.  Greater detail about how allocations are used is described by the following tables.

==== Restricted USM
Restricted USM defines capabilities for implicitly sharing data between host and devices.  However, Restricted USM, as the name implies, is limited in that host and device may not concurrently compute on memory in the shared address space.  Restricted USM builds upon Explicit USM by adding two new types of allocations, `host` and `shared`.  Allocations are obtained through SYCL allocator instead of the system allocator.  `shared` allocations may be limited by device memory.  Greater detail about the allocation types defined in Restricted USM and their usage is described by the following tables.

==== Concurrent USM
Concurrent USM builds upon Restricted USM by enabling concurrent access to `shared` allocations between host and devices.  Additionally, some implementations may support a working set of `shared` allocations larger than device memory.

==== System USM
System USM extends upon the previous tiers by performing all `shared` allocations with the normal system memory allocation routines.  In particular, programmers may now use `malloc` or C++ `new` instead of `sycl_malloc` to create `shared` allocations.  Likewise, `free` and `delete` are used instead of `sycl::free`.  Note that `host` and `device` allocations are unaffected by this change and must still be allocated using their respective USM functions.

=== Utility Functions

While the modern C++ `usm_allocator` interface is sufficient for specifying USM allocations and deallocations, many programmers may prefer C-style `malloc`-influenced APIs.  As a convenience to programmers, `malloc`-style APIs are also defined.  Additionally, other utility functions are specified in the following sections to perform various operations such as memory copies and initializations as well as to provide performance hints.

----

Parameters::
  * (1) `size_t num_bytes` - number of bytes to allocate
  * (2) `size_t count` - number of elements of type `T` to allocate
  * `const sycl::queue& q` - the SYCL `q` that provides the `device` (if applicable) and `context` to allocate against

===== get_pointer_type
[source,cpp]
----
usm::alloc get_pointer_type(const void *ptr, const context &ctxt);
----
Parameters::
  * `const void* ptr` - the pointer to query.
  * `const sycl::context& ctxt` - the SYCL `context` to which the USM allocation belongs
Return value:: Returns the USM allocation type for `ptr` if `ptr` falls inside a valid USM allocation.  If `ctxt` is a host `context`, returns `usm::alloc::host`.  Returns `usm::alloc::unknown` if `ptr` is not a valid USM allocation.

===== get_pointer_device
[source,cpp]
----
sycl::device get_pointer_device(const void *ptr, const context &ctxt);
----
Parameters::
 * `const void* ptr` - the pointer to query
 * `const sycl::context& ctxt` - the SYCL `context` to which the USM allocation belongs
 Return value:: Returns the `device` associated with the USM allocation.  If `ctxt` is a host `context`, returns the host `device` in `ctxt`.  If `ptr` is an allocation of type `usm::alloc::host`, returns the first device in `ctxt`.  Throws an error if `ptr` is not a valid USM allocation.

|`info::device::usm_restricted_shared_allocations`
|`bool`
|Returns `true` if this device supports `shared` allocations as governed by the restrictions described in Restricted USM on the device. This property requires that property `usm_shared_allocations` returns `true` for this device.


|`info::device::usm_system_allocator`

== SYCL Scheduling
SYCL 1.2.1 defines an execution model based on tasks submitted to Out-of-Order queues.  Dependences between these tasks are constructed from the data they read and write.  The data usage of a task is conveyed to the runtime by constructing accessors on buffer objects that specify their intent.  Pointers obtained from using explicit memory management interfaces in SYCL cannot create accessors, so dependence graphs cannot be constructed in the same fashion.  New methods are required to specify dependences between tasks.

=== DAGs without accessors
Unified Shared Memory changes how the SYCL runtime manages data movement.  Since the runtime might no longer be responsible for orchestrating data movement, it makes sense to enable a way to build dependence graphs based on ordering computations rather than accesses to data inside them.  Conveniently, a SYCL `queue` already returns an `event` upon calls to `submit`.  These events can be used by the programmer to wait for the submitted task to complete.

.Example
[source,cpp]
----
queue q;
auto dev = q.get_device();
auto ctxt = q.get_context();
float* a = static_cast<float*>(malloc_shared(10*sizeof(float), dev, ctxt));
float* b = static_cast<float*>(malloc_shared(10*sizeof(float), dev, ctxt));
float* c = static_cast<float*>(malloc_shared(10*sizeof(float), dev, ctxt));

auto e = q.submit([&](handler& cgh) {
  cgh.parallel_for<class vec_add>(range<1> {10}, [=](id<1> ID) {
    size_t i = ID[0];
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  });
});
e.wait();
----

=== Coarse Grain DAGs with cgh.depends_on
While SYCL already defines the capability to wait on specific tasks, programmers should still be able to easily define relationships between tasks.

[source,cpp]
----
class handler {
 ...
 public:
  ...
  void depends_on(event e);
  void depends_on(const vector_class<event> &e);
};
----

Parameters:: `e` - event or vector of events representing task(s) required to complete before this task may begin
Return value:: none

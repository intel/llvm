# SYCL Extensions in DPC++

The DPC++ compiler supports the [SYCL language][1].  In addition to the core
SYCL features, DPC++ also implements certain extensions, and this directory
contains the specifications for those extensions.  These extensions are
organized into subdirectories according to their state.

== Introduction
IMPORTANT: This functionality introduced by this extension is deprecated in
favor of the standard functionality outlined in
https://www.khronos.org/registry/SYCL/specs/sycl-2020/html/sycl-2020.html#sec:group-functions[Section
4.17.3 "Group functions"] and
https://www.khronos.org/registry/SYCL/specs/sycl-2020/html/sycl-2020.html#sec:algorithms[Section
4.17.4 "Group algorithms library"] of the SYCL 2020 Specification, Revision 3.
Note that the "leader" algorithm proposed here is not a free-function in SYCL
2020, but a member function of the `group` and `sub_group` classes.

Working Draft

This is a preview extension specification, intended to provide early access to a feature for review and community feedback. When the feature matures, this specification may be released as a formal extension.

Because the interfaces defined by this specification are not final and are subject to change they are not intended to be used by shipping software products.

== Version

Built On: {docdate} +
Revision: 1

== Contact
John Pennycook, Intel (john 'dot' pennycook 'at' intel 'dot' com)

== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SYCL 1.2.1 specification, Revision v1.2.1-6.

== Overview

This extension introduces a library of group algorithms, providing a simple way for developers to apply common parallel algorithms across data held by different work-items in the same group, or to use the work-items of a group to apply common parallel algorithms across data stored in memory.

The extension introduces the following functions:

- +any_of+
- +all_of+
- +none_of+
- +leader+
- +broadcast+
- +reduce+
- +exclusive_scan+
- +inclusive_scan+

=== Alignment with OpenCL vs C++

Where a feature is common to both OpenCL and {cpp}, this proposal opts for {cpp}-like naming:

- Collective operators are named as in +<functional>+ (e.g. +plus+ instead of +sum+) and to avoid clashes with names in +<algorithm>+ (e.g. +minimum+ instead of +min+).
- Algorithms are named as in +<algorithm>+ (e.g. +inclusive_scan+ instead of +scan_inclusive+).

=== Towards a Generic Group Interface

This extension adds a number of static members to the +group+ class to simplify the interfaces of the functions in this library:

- +id_type+: The type used to represent work-item IDs within the group
- +range_type+: The type used to represent the range of the group
- +linear_id_type+: The type used to represent linear work-item IDs within the group
- +dimensions+: An integral value representing the dimensionality of the group

[source, c++]
----
template <int Dimensions = 1>
class group
{
public:
  using id_type = id<Dimensions>;
  using range_type = range<Dimensions>;
  using linear_id_type = size_t;
  static constexpr int dimensions = Dimensions;
};
----

=== Data Types

All functions are supported for the fundamental scalar types supported by SYCL and instances of the SYCL +vec+ class. The fundamental scalar types (as defined in Section 6.5 of the SYCL 1.2.1 specification) are: +bool+, +char+, +signed char+, +unsigned char+, +short int+, +unsigned short int+, +int+, +unsigned int+, +long int+, +unsigned long int+, +long long int+, +unsigned long long int+, +size_t+, +float+, +double+, +half+.

Functions with arguments of type +vec<T,N>+ are applied component-wise: they are semantically equivalent to N calls to a scalar function of type +T+.

=== Function Objects

A number of function objects are provided in the +cl::sycl::intel+ namespace.  These function objects are used for all interfaces requiring an operator to be specified.  All function objects obey C++ conversion and promotion rules.

Transparent function objects are provided if using a {cpp}14 compiler -- the parameter types and return type for transparent function objects will be deduced if +T+ is not specified.

The following function objects alias objects in the +<functional>+ header from the {cpp} standard library:

- +cl::sycl::intel::plus+
- +cl::sycl::intel::multiplies+
- +cl::sycl::intel::bit_and+
- +cl::sycl::intel::bit_or+
- +cl::sycl::intel::bit_xor+
- +cl::sycl::intel::logical_and+
- +cl::sycl::intel::logical_or+

New function objects without {cpp} standard library equivalents are defined in the table below:

|===
|Function Object|Description

|+template <typename T=void> struct minimum;+
|+T operator(const T&, const T&) const+ applies +std::less+ to its arguments, in the same order, then returns the lesser argument unchanged.

|+template <typename T=void> struct maximum;+
|+T operator(const T&, const T&) const+ applies +std::greater+ to its arguments, in the same order, then returns the greater argument unchanged.
|===

=== Functions

The group algorithms library is based on the algorithms library described in Section 28 of the {cpp}17 standard.  The syntax and restrictions are aligned, with two notable differences: the first argument to each function is a group of work-items, in place of an execution policy; and pointers are accepted in place of iterators in order to guarantee that address space information is visible to the compiler.

Group algorithms are performed collaboratively by the work-items in a group. All functions therefore act as synchronization points and must be encountered in converged control flow by all work-items in the group -- if one work-item in the group reaches the function, then all work-items in the group must reach the function.  Additionally, restrictions may be placed on the arguments passed to each function in order to ensure that all work-items in the group agree on the operation that is being performed.  Any such restrictions on the arguments passed to a function are defined within the descriptions of those functions.

Many functions provide at least two overloads: one operating directly on data produced by the work-items in the group, and another operating on a range of data in memory specified by a pair of pointers.  If the pointers passed to such a group function are not the same for all work-items in the group, their behavior is undefined.  How the elements of a range are processed by the work-items in a group is undefined.

Using functions from the group algorithms library inside of a kernel may introduce additional limits on the resources available to user code inside the same kernel (e.g. private memory, work-group local memory).  The behavior of these limits is implementation-defined, but must be reflected by calls to kernel querying functions such as +kernel::get_work_group_info+.

It is undefined behavior for any of these functions to be invoked within a +parallel_for_work_group+ or +parallel_for_work_item+ context, but this restriction may be lifted in a future version of the proposal.

A number of the restrictions regarding the types of parameters that are acceptable for each algorithm must implemented as constraints: group arguments must be of a supported group class type; binary operations must be one of the group algorithms function objects; pointer arguments must be pointers to fundamental data types; and value arguments must be scalar fundamental data types (or vectors of those types).

|+template <typename Group, typename T, class Predicate> bool none_of(Group g, T x, Predicate pred);+
|Return +true+ if _pred(x)_ is +true+ for no work-items in the group. _pred_ must be the same for all work-items in the group.
|===

|===
|Function|Description

|+template <typename Group, typename Ptr, class Predicate> bool any_of(Group g, Ptr first, Ptr last, Predicate pred);+
|Return +true+ if _pred_ returns +true+ for any element in the range [_first_, _last_). _first_, _last_ and _pred_ must be the same for all work-items in the group.

|+template <typename Group, typename Ptr, class Predicate> bool all_of(Group g, Ptr first, Ptr last, Predicate pred);+
|Return +true+ if _pred_ returns +true+ for all elements in the range [_first_, _last_). _first_, _last_ and _pred_ must be the same for all work-items in the group.

|Return +true+ if _pred_ returns +true+ for no element in the range [_first_, _last_). _first_, _last_ and _pred_ must be the same for all work-items in the group.
|===

==== Elect

The +leader+ function provides a mechanism to _elect_ a single work-item as the leader of the group, commonly in order to execute a task once per group.

|===
|Function|Description

|+template <typename Group> bool leader(Group g);+
|Return +true+ for exactly one work-item in the group, if the calling work-item is the elected leader of the group.  Every call to +leader+ with the same group _g_ must elect the same work-item.
|===

==== Collectives

In this section, the meaning of "exclusive scan" and "inclusive scan" are as defined in Sections 29.8.7 and 29.8.8 of the {cpp}17 specification, respectively.

The return types of the collective functions in {cpp}17 are not deduced from the return type of the specified binary operator, but from either the type of the input values or the type of the initialization value (if one is provided).  This is error-prone and can lead to unexpected behavior (e.g. specifying an initial value of `0` instead of `0.0f` for a floating-point reduction will cause the results to be accumulated in an integer).  To minimize the chances of encountering such errors, the collective functions in the group algorithms library place additional restrictions on type combinations that can be deduced.

== Issues

None.

//. asd

//*RESOLUTION*: Not resolved.

. How should `is_native_function_object` work?  Does it represent what is minimally required by the specification, or what the implementation really supports?
--
*RESOLUTION*: The `is_native_function_object` trait has been removed.  It proved too difficult to implement something that returned sensible values for transparent function objects (e.g. `std::plus<void>`) that did not also require checking additional traits for each individual group algorithm.  Requiring the user to implement their own checks based on type requirements outlined in the specification would make it significantly harder for implementers to extend the algorithms to types and function objects beyond what is specified.  Using constrained forms of the algorithms instead allows a user to determine whether an implementation of a particular algorithm exists using the C++ detection idiom.

== Feature test macro

This extension provides a feature-test macro as described in the core SYCL
specification section 6.3.3 "Feature test macros". Therefore, an implementation
supporting this extension must predefine the macro `SYCL_EXT_ONEAPI_GROUP_ALGORITHMS`
to one of the values defined in the table below. Applications can test for the
existence of this macro to determine if the implementation supports this
feature, or applications can test the macro's value to determine which of the
extension's APIs the implementation supports.

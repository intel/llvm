== Introduction
This document presents an addition proposed for a future version of the SYCL Specification.  This proposal adds a new queue property that may be specified during queue construction that modifies the behavior of the queue on destruction. Normally, queue destruction is non-blocking - it does not wait for enqueued operations to first complete.  Queues created with this property will first wait on all submitted operations before proceeding with normal destruction.

# Proposed Extensions

This directory contains the specifications for SYCL extensions that are
proposed for the DPC++ implementation.  These extensions are not implemented
in DPC++, so they cannot be used.  These extension documents are published
here to gather community feedback.

A proposed extension may eventually be implemented, thus promoting it to
"supported" or "experimental".  When this happens, the specification document
is generally moved to either the "supported" or "experimental" directory, and
there may also be some changes to its APIs.

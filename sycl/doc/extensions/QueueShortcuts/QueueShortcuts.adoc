== Introduction
This document presents an addition proposed for a future version of the SYCL Specification.  The goal of this proposal is to reduce the complexity and verbosity of using SYCL for programmers.

== Queue Simplifications
Tasks are submitted to queues for execution in SYCL.  This is normally done by invoking the `submit` method of a `queue` and passing a lambda that specifies the operation to perform and its dependences.  A task's dependences have traditionally been specified through the creation of `accessor` objects that tell the SYCL runtime how data in a `buffer` or `image` is used.  However, new proposals for data management in SYCL, such as Unified Shared Memory, provide alternatives to the buffer and accessor model.  The USM proposal specifies dependences between kernels using `event` objects.  The Queue Properties proposal specifies how to create a `queue` that has in-order semantics where each operation is performed after the previous operation has finished.

It makes sense, in a SYCL with those proposals, to provide programmers with shortcuts to eliminate unnecessary extra code.  When using in-order queues, for example, the lambda passed to `submit` does nothing except invoke `parallel_for` or `single_task`.  This proposal adds the kernel specification methods directly to the `queue` class.  These additional methods have two flavors.  The first handles the "empty lambda" case.  The second handles the USM dependence case by adding methods that take an `event` or vector of `events` that specify the dependences that must be satisfied before the kernel executes.  Both flavors could be implemented in a header file by specifying the `submit` lambda for the programmer.

Note: These simplifications do not depend on queue order properties.  They apply both for in-order and out-of-order queues.

Overloads 4-12 shall support generic lambda as the kernel argument. For overloads 4-9 the generic argument is the `item` with the same dimensions that `range` argument has. For overloads 10-12 the generic argument is the `nd_item` with the same dimensions that `nd_range` argument has.

Overloads 4-6 shall support number or `braced-init-list` as the `range` argument.

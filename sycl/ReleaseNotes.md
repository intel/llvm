## New Features

### SYCL Compiler

- Added `-fsycl-range-rounding` command line option which allows control over
  the range rounding feature. In comparison with the previously available
  `-fsycl-disable-range-rounding` command line option and
  `__SYCL_DISABLE_PARALLEL_FOR_RANGE_ROUNDING__` macro the new flag also allows
  to _force_ range rounding which will completely disable the generation of
  non-rounded kernels, thus improving binary size. intel/llvm#12715
- Added `-fsycl-exp-range-rounding` command line option that enables
  experimental range rounding mode in which range rounding is performed across
  all dimensions. intel/llvm#12690
- Added support for the so-called [new offloading model](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/ebb3b4a21b3b0e977f44434781729df7de83e436/sycl/doc/design/OffloadDesign.md).
  It can be enabled by the `--offload-new-driver` command line option and
  provides an improved infrastructure for us. In the future we expect to
  leverage that infrastructure to improve link times by reducing the amount of
  I/O used by the compiler and the amount of external processes that it spawns.
  The foundation for this work has been performed in previous release time frame
  and the following list of PRs only includes those done within this release
  time frame. intel/llvm#14252 intel/llvm#13394 intel/llvm#13648 intel/llvm#13687
  intel/llvm#14001 intel/llvm#14006 intel/llvm#14101 intel/llvm#14151
  intel/llvm#14253 intel/llvm#14177 intel/llvm#13672 intel/llvm#13688
  intel/llvm#13579 intel/llvm#13869 intel/llvm#14102 intel/llvm#14541
  intel/llvm#14541 intel/llvm#13898 intel/llvm#14143
  allow us to improve link time by reducing amount of external processes and
  temporary files used by the compiler.
- Added `-fsycl-fp64-conv-emu` command line option which allows the enabling of
  partial (only conversion operations are supported) emulation of `double` data
  type. This mode is only supported by Intel GPUs. intel/llvm#13912
- Introduced `__PTX_VERSION__` macro that corresponds to the PTX version used
  when compiling NVPTX. intel/llvm#14621
- Added support for `::rand` and `::srand` in device code on Intel devices. intel/llvm#13506
- Added support for `sm90a` CUDA target architecture. intel/llvm#14075
- Added support for detecting misaligned data accesses via address sanitizer. intell/llvm#14148
- Added support for emitting multiple error reports via address sanitizer
  through `-fsanitize-recover=address`. intel/llvm#13948
- Added initial support for
  [dynamic linking](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/ebb3b4a21b3b0e977f44434781729df7de83e436/sycl/doc/design/SharedLibraries.md).
  Current implementation lacks support for `kernel_bundle` API and AOT mode.
  intel/llvm#14587 intel/llvm#14189 intel/llvm#14103
- Added `-fno-sycl-decompose-functor` compiler flag which instructs compiler
  to emit less kernel arguments if possible. The flag is experimental and it
  only has effect when compiling for CUDA targets. intel/llvm#14434

### SYCL Library

- Added support for JIT-compilation for AMD and NVIDIA backends. intel/llvm#14280
- Implemented [`sycl_ext_oneapi_prod`](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/ebb3b4a21b3b0e977f44434781729df7de83e436/sycl/doc/extensions/supported/sycl_ext_oneapi_prod.asciidoc) extension. intel/llvm#13555
- Implemented [`sycl_ext_oneapi_profiling_tag`](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/ebb3b4a21b3b0e977f44434781729df7de83e436/sycl/doc/extensions/experimental/sycl_ext_oneapi_profiling_tag.asciidoc) extension. intel/llvm#12838

- Implemented
  [`sycl_ext_oneapi_enqueue_functions`](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/ebb3b4a21b3b0e977f44434781729df7de83e436/sycl/doc/extensions/experimental/sycl_ext_oneapi_enqueue_functions.asciidoc)
  extension. intel/llvm#13512 intel/llvm#13924 intel/llvm#14743

  Please note that the implementation exposes native block read/write HW
  capabilities only if the operation can be directly mapped to a single block
  operation. In other cases, it uses a naive implementation in form of a simple
  loop and group barriers. intel/llvm#13043 intel/llvm#13734 intel/llvm#13673
- Implemented [`sycl_ext_codeplay_enqueue_native_command`](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/ebb3b4a21b3b0e977f44434781729df7de83e436/sycl/doc/extensions/experimental/sycl_ext_codeplay_enqueue_native_command.asciidoc) extension. intel/llvm#14136

  Known limitations:
    - free function kernels are only supported if defined at file scope
    - `SYCL_EXTERNAL` has to be used alongside `SYCL_EXT_ONEAPI_FUNCTION_PROPERTY`
      to define free function kernel
    - compiler won't emit any diagnostics if some restrictions from the
      extension specification are violated
    - arguments of a free function kernels cannot be composite data types like
      structs or SYCL classes like `accessor`
    - using `-fsycl-dead-args-optimization` (ON by default) can lead to failures
    - `info::kernel::num_args` won't return the right result for free function
      kernels
- Added experimental ESIMD function `fma` which results in a guaranteed fused
  multiply-add operation performed. intel/llvm#13366
- Implemented revision 2 of
  [`sycl_ext_oneapi_group_sort`](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/ebb3b4a21b3b0e977f44434781729df7de83e436/sycl/doc/extensions/experimental/sycl_ext_oneapi_group_sort.asciidoc)

## Improvements

### SYCL Compiler

- Improved compilation flow around integration footer when no 3rd-party host
  compiler is used. New compilation flow creates less temporary files and
  therefore should result in a slightly faster compilation. intel/llvm#13607 intel/llvm#14402
- Added support for `truncf`, `sinpif`, `rsqrtf`, `exp10f`, `ceilf`,
  `copysignf`, `cospif`, `fmaxf` and `fminf` functions in SYCL kernels as part of
  [C-CXX-StandardLibrary](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/ebb3b4a21b3b0e977f44434781729df7de83e436/sycl/doc/extensions/supported/C-CXX-StandardLibrary.rst)
  extension. intel/llvm#14132 intel/llvm#13714
- Added support for more IMF functions as part of [C-CXX-StandardLibrary](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/ebb3b4a21b3b0e977f44434781729df7de83e436/sycl/doc/extensions/supported/C-CXX-StandardLibrary.rst) extension. intel/llvm#13786
- Added `-fsystem-debug` command line option to complement existing
  `-fno-system-debug`. intel/llvm#13256
- Improved wording of an error about implicit `this` capture in a kernel. intel/llvm#14100
- Improved `--save-temps` to work with `-fsycl-host-compiler`. intel/llvm#14751
- Improved error message about missing AMDGPU architecture when several values
  are passed into `-fsycl-targets`. intel/llvm#13078
- Reduced list of commands invoked to generate dependencies using `-MD` flag
  by one command. intel/llvm#13217
- Enhanced diagnostic emitted if CUDA target triple passed to `-fsycl-targets`
  is incorrect. intel/llvm#14673
- Reduced size of shadow memory used by address sanitizer to avoid running out
  of memory in multi-GPU environments. intel/llvm#13857
- Enhanced address sanitizer to be able to detect out-of-bounds access to
  local accessors. intel/llvm#13503
- Enhanced address sanitizer to detect incorrect uses of USM deallocation
  functions (like calling `sycl::free` on a pointer that was not allocated as
  a USM pointer). intel/llvm#12882
- Enhanced `-fintelfpga` flag. When used together with `-fp-module=fast` it
  also implies that `-vpfp-relaxed` will be passed to backend (device) compiler.
  intel/llvm#13651
- Implemented support for `memory_order::seq_cst` on CUDA backend, resolving
  intel/llvm#11208. intel/llvm#12516
- Implementation of optional kernel features mechanism has been extended to also
  support AOT compilation if so-called "special" targets are passed to
  `-fsycl-targets` (see corresponding
  [documentation](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/ebb3b4a21b3b0e977f44434781729df7de83e436/sycl/doc/UsersManual.md#generic-options)).
  Please note that this functionality relies on the compile knowing which
  targets support which optional kernel features and that database is not yet
  fully complete. In particular, data for Lunar Lake and Battlemage Intel GPUs
  is still missing. intel/llvm#14590 intel/llvm#14188 intel/lvm#12727
  intel/llvm#14757 intel/llvm#13486 intel/llvm#13974 intel/llvm#13617
- Enhanced compiler to annotate SYCL kernel arguments passed by value with
  `__grid_constant__` for CUDA backend. intel/llvm#14322
- Added initial support for sub-groups on Native CPU backend. intel/llvm#13979
- Added support for `reqd_work_group_size` attribute to Native CPU backend.
  intel/llvm#13175
- Introduced some extra address space inference for `invoke_simd` API so that
  backends are able to generate better code. intel/llvm#14628
- Improved math built-ins support on Native CPU backend: added support for bf16
  and pointers in generic address space. intel/llvm#13109 intel/llvm#13829
  intel/llvm#13911 intel/llvm#13428 intel/llvm#13478 intel/llvm#13249
  intel/llvm#13765
- Improved debugging experience on Linux (CPU & GPU) and Windows (CPU AOT only).
  intel/llvm#13107 intel/llvm#13938
- Optimized device code linking process by providing device libraries in LLVM
  IR format instead of fat object files which allowed us to skip unbundling
  step. Note: FPGA path still uses fat object files.
  intel/llvm#13604 intel/llvm#13693
- Added missing lowering of `reqd_work_group_size` attribute for CUDA devices
  so that device compiler can now see the attribute and use it during
  compilation. intel/llvm#14502
- Strengthened security-related compilation flags used to build libraries and
  tools which are part of the intel/llvm SYCL implementation. intel/llvm#13327
  intel/llvm#14135 intel/llvm#13800

- Extended detection of nested `queue` operations to support shortcut methods. intel/llvm#13659
- Added overloads of various ESIMD APIs (`atomic_update`, `block_[load|store]`
  and some other) which allow thee omission of some template arguments, thus
  simplifying the interface. intel/llvm#14043 intel/llvm#14065 intel/llvm#14000
  intel/llvm#14024 intel/llvm#13978 intel/llvm#13964 intel/llvm#13977

  sub- and sub-sub- devices and its architecture. intel/llvm#13999 intel/llvm#13976
- Added support for compile-time properties to `copy_to` and `copy_from` ESIMD
  APIs. intel/llvm#13586

  promotion in `printf` arguments. intel/llvm#13055
- Added a diagnostic if `slm_init` ESIMD API is called more than once in
  a kernel. intel/llvm#12804
- Updated implementation of
  [`sycl_ext_oneapi_device_architecture`](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/ebb3b4a21b3b0e977f44434781729df7de83e436/sycl/doc/extensions/experimental/sycl_ext_oneapi_device_architecture.asciidoc)

- Added deprecation messages for `image_max_array_size` and `opencl_c_version`
  device info queries. intel/llvm#13279
- Updated [`sycl_ext_intel_device_info`](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/ebb3b4a21b3b0e977f44434781729df7de83e436/sycl/doc/extensions/supported/sycl_ext_intel_device_info.md)
  extension implementation to throw synchronious exception with
  `feature_not_supported` error code. intel/llvm#14788
- Reduced startup overhead of `libsycl.so` by outlining SYCL JIT compiler (used
  for kernel fusion feature) into a standalone library which is dynamically
  loaded on the first use. intel/llvm#13433
- Deprecated `this_kernel::get_root_group` in favor of
  `this_work_item::get_root_group`. intel/llvm#13304
- Relaxed diagnostic about using virtual functions in SYCL kernels: now it is
  only emitted if a call is perfomed using virtual call mechanism, but it is not
  emitted for non-virtual calls of virtual functions. See also
  KhronosGroup/SYCL-Docs#565. intel/llvm#114051 intel/llvm#14141
- ESIMD API `inv` was extended to support `double` arguments. intel/llvm#13838
- Enhanced validation (via `static_assert` mechanism) of template arguments of
  ESIMD `rdregion` and `wrregion` APIs. intel/llvm#13158
- Aligned mutating swizzle operators with the SYCL 2020 specification by making
  it a `friend` instead of member function. intel/llvm#13012
- Aligned `vec` conversion operator to a scalar with the SYCL 2020 specification

- Enabled `ext_intel_matrix` support for Intel GNR devices. intel/llvm#14436
- Added support for 1x64x16 `bfloat16` matrices on PVC. intel/llvm#13391
- Added new overloads of `load_2d`, `store_2d` or `prefetch_2d` ESIMD APIs that
  accept compile-time properties. intel/llvm#13046
- Added support for `shift_group_left`, `shift_group_right`,
  `permute_group_by_xor` and `select_from_group` algorithms for non-uniform
  groups. intel/llvm#12705
- Removed Plugin Interface. That is a collection of internal libraries which
  implemented unified interface to various lower-level runtimes like OpenCL,
  Level Zero, etc. It is now completely replaced by
  [Unified Runtime](https://github.com/oneapi-src/unified-runtime/) and this
  removal should reduce amount and size of redistributable libraries.
- Enhanced ESIMD `slm_atomic_update` API to also support `fsub` and `fadd`
  operations. intel/llvm#13535
- Lifted some of the restrictions from ESIMD `block_store` API. intel/llvm#13150
- Added support for graph update functionality. intel/llvm#12840
- Added support for external semaphore wait and signal operations that can take
  a value to bindless images extension. intel/llvm#13860
- Added support for device-to-device copying of `image_device_handle`.
  intel/llvm#12449
- Improved performance of `queue::fill` on CUDA backend by making it use 2- and
  4-byte operations instead of only using 1-byte operations. intel/llvm#13788
  intel/llvm#13779
- Enhanced `sycl_ext_oneapi_graph` extension implementation on Level Zero
  backend by taking advantage of copy engines available on some devices to be
  able to execute kernels and memory operations in parallel. intel/llvm#13051
- Expanded list of supported atomic memory fence scopes supported by HIP
  devices. intel/llvm#12872
- Added SYCL wrappers for more Intel Math Functions. SYCL wrappers are in
  `sycl::ext::intel::math::` namespace and provide nicer names that do not
  start with `__`. intel/llvm#13762
- Added initial support for bindless images on Intel GPUs (only DG2 and MTL).
  It is very limited in functionality that is supported and it only works if
  certain environment variables are set. Therefore, it is not yet ready for a
  wide adoption, but could be used for very early adoption. intel/llvm#13946
  intel/llvm#13753 intel/llvm#14493 intel/llvm#14266
- Introduced an optimization to graphs where linear graphs would require less
  amount of synchronization. This optimization is backend-specific and only
  performed in very limited amount of cases. intel/llvm#13088
- Implemented new `fetch_image` overload which accepts sampled image and
  coordinates. intel/llvm#12447
- Extended address sanitizer support to cover Intel DG2 GPUs. intel/llvm#13450
- Updated `info::device::max_mem_alloc_size` query to return total amount of
  a device memory for CUDA devices, because they have no limit on size of
  memory allocations. intel/llvm#13344

  produced by `llvm-ar` would result in runtime error from JIT compilation
  about that `SYCL_EXTERNAL` function being unresolved. intel/llvm#14256
- Fixed a bug where calling `sycl::make_device` using an interop object obtained
  from a SYCL `device` object would result in a device that is not equally
  comparable with the original `device` object. See related issue
  intel/llvm#6055. The bug is fixed for Level Zero backend, but it still may
  exhibit itself on OpenCL backend when sub-devices are involved.
  intel/llvm#13483
- Partially fixed profiling information provided by events from in-order queues
  that have barries submitted to them. There are still issues on Level Zero
  backend due to certain optimizations that it performs for barriers in
  in-order queues. intel/llvm#14123

  return `device`-specific limit ignoring the kernel on Level Zero backend.
  intel/llvm#13474

## Misc

### SYCL Compiler

- Reverted changes previously made as a bugfix on Windows to support a separate
  compilation scenario where compilation step is performed _without_ the
  `-fsycl` flag, but link step _with_ the `-fsycl` flag, expecting the compiler
  to do the right thing. However, this is now considered to be a unsupported
  scenario, because during link step the compiler doesn't know which version
  (debug or release) of the standard library to link. intel/llvm#13326

## API/ABI Breaking Changes

This release is an *ABI* breaking release, meaning that any applications which
were built using older versions of the toolchain have to be recompiled in order
to be launched using newer versions of SYCL runtime library.

- Bumped major version of SYCL runtime library to `8`. intel/llvm#13097
- Cleaned up list of symbols exported from SYCL runtime library: dropped some
  legacy symbols, hidden some symbols which shouldn't have been exported in the
  first place, etc.

  intel/llvm#13597 intel/llvm#13271
- Updated ABI of several functions/methods to avoid using `std::string` and
  some other objects in library interface. This should allow to use SYCL RT
  in applications which were built with pre-C++11 ABI.
  intel/llvm#13183 intel/llvm#13549 intel/llvm#13560 intel/llvm#13212
  intel/llvm#13213 intel/llvm#13447
- Changed `ext_oneapi_copy` API from experimental
  `sycl_ext_oneapi_bindless_images` extension to accept `const`-qualified
  types for `Src` parameter. intel/llvm#14140

Several API breaking changes were made as well, mostly completely dropping
support for previously deprecated APIs and in some cases switching
implementations of some classes to use so-called preview implementation.

- Removed `sycl::abs` overload taking floating-point argument. intel/llvm#13286
- Removed `sycl::host_ptr` and `sycl::device_ptr`. intel/llvm#13240
- Removed `queue::discard_or_return`. intel/llvm#14550
- Removed `sycl::make_unique_ptr`. intel/llvm#13232

## Known Issues

- On Windows, the Unified Runtime's Level Zero leak check does not work correctly with
  the default contexts on Windows. This is because on Windows the release
  of the plugin DLLs races against the release of static global variables
  (like the default context).
- Intel Graphic Compiler's Vector Compute backend does not support O0 code and
  often gets miscompiled, produces wrong answers and crashes. This issue directly
  affects ESIMD code at O0. As a temporary workaround, we have optimize ESIMD code
  even in O0 mode.
  [00749b1e8](https://github.com/intel/llvm/commit/00749b1e8e3085acfdc63108f073a255842533e2)
- [new] Use of some SYCL math built-ins (like `abs` or `clz`) in a program where
  `sycl/ext/intel/esimd.hpp` header is included causes compilation errors.
  This will be fixed in the next release (intel/llvm#14793)
- [new] When using `sycl_ext_oneapi_matrix` extension it is important for some
  devices to use the sm version (Compute Capability) corresponding to the device
  that will run the program, i.e. use `-fsycl-targets=nvidia_gpu_sm_xx` during
  compilation. This particularly affects matrix operations using `half` data
  type. For more information on this issue consult with
  https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#wmma-restrictions
- [new] When using `queue` shortcut functions with in-order queues dependencies
  between commands submitted to different queues may be ignored:
  ```c++
  // q1 long running task
  sycl::event e = q1.single_task([=](){ /* ... */ });
  // q2 task
  q2.single_task(e, [=](){ /* ... */ });
  ```
  In the example above, the seocnd kernel will start execution *before* the
  first completes its execution. A workaround is to explicitly call `.wait()`.
  This will be fixed in the next release, see intel/llvm#15412
- [new] C/C++ math built-ins (like `exp` or `tanh`) can return incorrect
  results for some edge-case input when they are called from SYCL kernels.

## Known Issues
- On Windows, the Unified Runtime's Level Zero leak check does not work correctly with
the default contexts on Windows. This is because on Windows the release
of the plugin DLLs races against the release of static global variables
(like the default context).
- Intel Graphic Compiler's Vector Compute backend does not support O0 code and often gets miscompiled, produces wrong answers and crashes. This issue directly affects ESIMD code at O0. As a temporary workaround, we have optimize ESIMD code even in O0 mode. [00749b1e8](https://github.com/intel/llvm/commit/00749b1e8e3085acfdc63108f073a255842533e2)
- `multi_ptr` relational operators assume the lowest possible value of `std::null_ptr` which might cause issues with the CUDA and AMDGPU backends. This will be fixed in the next release. ([13201](https://github.com/intel/llvm/pull/13201))
- When `-fsycl-device-code-split=off` is set, having kernels with different `reqd_work_group_size` attributes could lead to runtime errors about local size mismatching the attribute value. The issue is also reproducible when there is a kernel with `reqd_work_group_size` attribute, but other kernels don't have that attribute set. This will be fixed in the next release. ([#13523](https://github.com/intel/llvm/pull/13523))
- Having default-constructed `local_accessor` as unused kernel argument could lead to runtime errors during kernel arguments setting. The issue is reproducible when optimizations are explicitly disabled through `-O0`, or when optimizations failed to remove that unused kernel argument. This will be fixed in the next release. ([#13382](https://github.com/intel/llvm/pull/13382))
- ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR incorrectly parses `!` from discard filters. This will be fixed in the next release. ([SYCL] Fix ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR handling of discard filters. #13927)

## API/ABI breaking changes
- Renamed and removed some APIs from [ext_oneapi_free_function_queries](https://github.com/intel/llvm/commit/287fd3733#diff-4ab48d4a7f26c356939d42c6aed9c67d4d59aafac11565f3bfe71d7e053a4db4) SYCL extension. [287fd3733]

## Upcoming API/ABI breakages
The following changes ared only in effect if the `-fpreview-breaking-changes` flag is set.
- Changed return type of `abs_diff` to be same as that of the input. [2a3e1ab82]
- Added a preview of pre-C++11 ABI support for GCC on Linux.  This feature  allows users to set a GCC compiler flag -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0 to use pre-C++11 ABI. Details about GCC C++11 ABI is available at https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html. In this release, this feature is enabled under the flag -fpreview-breaking-changes, and the support is incomplete and may not work for some cases.  [459e122a]
- Removed some sub-group class APIs that do not appear in SYCL 2020 Spec. [2985395]

- Removed ESIMD Emulator plugin [1ece6da6b113]

## Upcoming API/ABI breakages
The following changes ared only in effect if the `-fpreview-breaking-changes` flag is set.
- Fixed sycl::vec ABI inconsistencies and made it trivially copyable [531aabfdee91] [f4ed132f243a] 
- Updated `sycl.hpp` to not include `<complex>` and `<cmath>` [6ed0ab887d18] [d22c9c58d2e7]

## Known Issues
- Having MESA OpenCL implementation which provides no devices on a
  system may cause incorrect device discovery. As a workaround such an OpenCL
  implementation can be disabled by removing `/etc/OpenCL/vendor/mesa.icd`.
- `-fsycl-dead-args-optimization` can't help eliminate offset of
  accessor even though it's created with no offset specified
- SYCL 2020 barriers show worse performance than SYCL 1.2.1 do. [18c80faa]
- When using fallback assert in separate compilation flow it requires explicit
  linking against `lib/libsycl-fallback-cassert.o` or
  `lib/libsycl-fallback-cassert.spv`
- Limit alignment of allocation requests at 64KB which is the only alignment
  supported by Level Zero. 7dfaf3bd
- User-defined functions with the name and signature matching those of any
  OpenCL C built-in function (i.e. an exact match of arguments, return type
  doesn't matter) can lead to Undefined Behavior.
- A DPC++ system that has FPGAs installed does not support multi-process
  execution. Creating a context opens the device associated with the context
  and places a lock on it for that process. No other process may use that
  device. Some queries about the device through `device.get_info<>()` also
  open up the device and lock it to that process since the runtime needs
  to query the actual device to obtain that information.
- The format of the object files produced by the compiler can change between
  versions. The workaround is to rebuild the application.
- Using `sycl::kernel_bundle` API to refer to a kernel defined
  in another translation unit leads to undefined behavior.
- Linkage errors with the following message:
  `error LNK2005: "bool const std::_Is_integral<bool>" (??$_Is_integral@_N@std@@3_NB) already defined`
  can happen when a SYCL application is built using MS Visual Studio 2019
  version below 16.3.0 and user specifies `-std=c++14` or `/std:c++14`.
- Printing internal defines isn't supported on Windows. [50628db1]
- The support of accessor and local_accessor for ESIMD is still limited comparing to SYCL.
- [`sycl_ext_oneapi_root_group`](https://github.com/intel/llvm/tree/743c35be2da7/sycl/doc/extensions/proposed/sycl_ext_oneapi_root_group.asciidoc) implementation has the following limitations: `max_num_work_group_sync` query always returns `1` and the implemented barrier has work group scope since all work items in a root group are currently in the same work group.

[f363bb272b5a]

## Known issues
- Having MESA OpenCL implementation which provides no devices on a
  system may cause incorrect device discovery. As a workaround such an OpenCL
  implementation can be disabled by removing `/etc/OpenCL/vendor/mesa.icd`.
- `-fsycl-dead-args-optimization` can't help eliminate offset of
  accessor even though it's created with no offset specified
- SYCL 2020 barriers show worse performance than SYCL 1.2.1 do. [18c80faa]
- When using fallback assert in separate compilation flow it requires explicit
  linking against `lib/libsycl-fallback-cassert.o` or
  `lib/libsycl-fallback-cassert.spv`
- Limit alignment of allocation requests at 64KB which is the only alignment
  supported by Level Zero. 7dfaf3bd
- User-defined functions with the name and signature matching those of any
  OpenCL C built-in function (i.e. an exact match of arguments, return type
  doesn't matter) can lead to Undefined Behavior.
- A DPC++ system that has FPGAs installed does not support multi-process
  execution. Creating a context opens the device associated with the context
  and places a lock on it for that process. No other process may use that
  device. Some queries about the device through `device.get_info<>()` also
  open up the device and lock it to that process since the runtime needs
  to query the actual device to obtain that information.
- The format of the object files produced by the compiler can change between
  versions. The workaround is to rebuild the application.
- Using `sycl::kernel_bundle` API to refer to a kernel defined
  in another translation unit leads to undefined behavior
- Linkage errors with the following message:
  `error LNK2005: "bool const std::_Is_integral<bool>" (??$_Is_integral@_N@std@@3_NB) already defined`
  can happen when a SYCL application is built using MS Visual Studio 2019
  version below 16.3.0 and user specifies `-std=c++14` or `/std:c++14`.
- Printing internal defines isn't supported on Windows. [50628db1]
- The support of accessor and local_accessor for ESIMD is still limited comparing to SYCL.
- [`sycl_ext_oneapi_root_group`](https://github.com/intel/llvm/tree/743c35be2da7/sycl/doc/extensions/proposed/sycl_ext_oneapi_root_group.asciidoc) implementation has the following limitations: `max_num_work_group_sync` query always returns `1` and the implemented barrier has work group scope since all work items in a root group are currently in the same work group.

## Known issues
- Having MESA OpenCL implementation which provides no devices on a
  system may cause incorrect device discovery. As a workaround such an OpenCL
  implementation can be disabled by removing `/etc/OpenCL/vendor/mesa.icd`.
- Compilation may fail on Windows in debug mode if a kernel uses
  `std::array`.  This happens because debug version of `std::array` in
  Microsoft STL C++ headers calls functions that are illegal for the device
  code. As a workaround the following can be done:
   1. Dump compiler pipeline execution strings by passing `-###` option to the
      compiler. The compiler will print the internal execution strings of
      compilation tools. The actual compilation will not happen.
   2. Modify the (usually) first execution string (it should have
      `-fsycl-is-device` option) by adding
      `-D_CONTAINER_DEBUG_LEVEL=0 -D_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL=0` options to the
      end of the string.  Execute all string one by one.
- `-fsycl-dead-args-optimization` can't help eliminate offset of
  accessor even though it's created with no offset specified
- SYCL 2020 barriers show worse performance than SYCL 1.2.1 do. [18c80faa]
- When using fallback assert in separate compilation flow it requires explicit
  linking against `lib/libsycl-fallback-cassert.o` or
  `lib/libsycl-fallback-cassert.spv`
- Limit alignment of allocation requests at 64KB which is the only alignment
  supported by Level Zero. 7dfaf3bd
- User-defined functions with the name and signature matching those of any
  OpenCL C built-in function (i.e. an exact match of arguments, return type
  doesn't matter) can lead to Undefined Behavior.
- A DPC++ system that has FPGAs installed does not support multi-process
  execution. Creating a context opens the device associated with the context
  and places a lock on it for that process. No other process may use that
  device. Some queries about the device through `device.get_info<>()` also
  open up the device and lock it to that process since the runtime needs
  to query the actual device to obtain that information.
- The format of the object files produced by the compiler can change between
  versions. The workaround is to rebuild the application.
- Using `sycl::kernel_bundle` API to refer to a kernel defined
  in another translation unit leads to undefined behavior
- Linkage errors with the following message:
  `error LNK2005: "bool const std::_Is_integral<bool>" (??$_Is_integral@_N@std@@3_NB) already defined`
  can happen when a SYCL application is built using MS Visual Studio 2019
  version below 16.3.0 and user specifies `-std=c++14` or `/std:c++14`.
- Printing internal defines isn't supported on Windows. [50628db1]

# Known issues

- This release is not backwards compatible with previous releases, which means
  that existing SYCL applications won't work with the newer runtime without
  re-compilation.
- Having MESA OpenCL implementation which provides no devices on a
  system may cause incorrect device discovery. As a workaround such an OpenCL
  implementation can be disabled by removing `/etc/OpenCL/vendor/mesa.icd`.
- Compilation may fail on Windows in debug mode if a kernel uses
  `std::array`.  This happens because debug version of `std::array` in
  Microsoft STL C++ headers calls functions that are illegal for the device
  code. As a workaround the following can be done:
   1. Dump compiler pipeline execution strings by passing `-###` option to the
      compiler. The compiler will print the internal execution strings of
      compilation tools. The actual compilation will not happen.
   2. Modify the (usually) first execution string (it should have
      `-fsycl-is-device` option) by adding
      `-D_CONTAINER_DEBUG_LEVEL=0 -D_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL=0` options to the
      end of the string.  Execute all string one by one.
- `-fsycl-dead-args-optimization` can't help eliminate offset of
  accessor even though it's created with no offset specified
- SYCL 2020 barriers show worse performance than SYCL 1.2.1 do. [18c80faa]
- When using fallback assert in separate compilation flow it requires explicit
  linking against `lib/libsycl-fallback-cassert.o` or
  `lib/libsycl-fallback-cassert.spv`
- Limit alignment of allocation requests at 64KB which is the only alignment
  supported by Level Zero. 7dfaf3bd
- On the following scenario on Level Zero backend:
   1. Kernel A, which uses buffer A, is submitted to queue A.
   2. Kernel B, which uses buffer B, is submitted to queue B.
   3. `queueA.wait()`.
   4. `queueB.wait()`.
  DPCPP runtime used to treat unmap/write commands for buffer A/B as host
  dependencies (i.e. they were waited for prior to enqueueing any command
  that's dependent on them). This allowed Level Zero plugin to detect that
  each queue is idle on steps 1/2 and submit the command list right away.
  This is no longer the case since we started passing these dependencies in an
  event waitlist and Level Zero plugin attempts to batch these commands, so
  the execution of kernel B starts only on step 4. The workaround restores the
  old behavior in this case until this is resolved. [2023e10d] [6c137f87]
- User-defined functions with the name and signature matching those of any
  OpenCL C built-in function (i.e. an exact match of arguments, return type
  doesn't matter) can lead to Undefined Behavior.
- A DPC++ system that has FPGAs installed does not support multi-process
  execution. Creating a context opens the device associated with the context
  and places a lock on it for that process. No other process may use that
  device. Some queries about the device through `device.get_info<>()` also
  open up the device and lock it to that process since the runtime needs
  to query the actual device to obtain that information.
- The format of the object files produced by the compiler can change between
  versions. The workaround is to rebuild the application.
- Using `sycl::kernel_bundle` API to refer to a kernel defined
  in another translation unit leads to undefined behavior
- Linkage errors with the following message:
  `error LNK2005: "bool const std::_Is_integral<bool>" (??$_Is_integral@_N@std@@3_NB) already defined`
  can happen when a SYCL application is built using MS Visual Studio 2019
  version below 16.3.0 and user specifies `-std=c++14` or `/std:c++14`.
- Printing internal defines isn't supported on Windows. [50628db1]

# Known issues
 - Having MESA OpenCL implementation which provides no devices on a
   system may cause incorrect device discovery. As a workaround such an OpenCL
   implementation can be disabled by removing `/etc/OpenCL/vendor/mesa.icd`.
 - Compilation may fail on Windows in debug mode if a kernel uses
   `std::array`.  This happens because debug version of `std::array` in
   Microsoft STL C++ headers calls functions that are illegal for the device
   code. As a workaround the following can be done:
    1. Dump compiler pipeline execution strings by passing `-###` option to the
       compiler. The compiler will print the internal execution strings of
       compilation tools. The actual compilation will not happen.
    2. Modify the (usually) first execution string (it should have
       `-fsycl-is-device` option) by adding
       `-D_CONTAINER_DEBUG_LEVEL=0 -D_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL=0` options to the
       end of the string.  Execute all string one by one.
 - `-fsycl-dead-args-optimization` can't help eliminate offset of
   accessor even though it's created with no offset specified
 - SYCL 2020 barriers show worse performance than SYCL 1.2.1 do [18c80fa]
 - When using fallback assert in separate compilation flow it requires explicit
   linking against `lib/libsycl-fallback-cassert.o` or
   `lib/libsycl-fallback-cassert.spv`
 - Limit alignment of allocation requests at 64KB which is the only alignment
   supported by Level Zero[7dfaf3bd]
 - On the following scenario on Level Zero backend:
    1. Kernel A, which uses buffer A, is submitted to queue A.
    2. Kernel B, which uses buffer B, is submitted to queue B.
    3. `queueA.wait()`.
    4. `queueB.wait()`.
   DPCPP runtime used to treat unmap/write commands for buffer A/B as host
   dependencies (i.e. they were waited for prior to enqueueing any command
   that's dependent on them). This allowed Level Zero plugin to detect that
   each queue is idle on steps 1/2 and submit the command list right away.
   This is no longer the case since we started passing these dependencies in an
   event waitlist and Level Zero plugin attempts to batch these commands, so
   the execution of kernel B starts only on step 4. The workaround restores the
   old behavior in this case until this is resolved [2023e10d][6c137f87].
 - User-defined functions with the name and signature matching those of any
   OpenCL C built-in function (i.e. an exact match of arguments, return type
   doesn't matter) can lead to Undefined Behavior.
 - A DPC++ system that has FPGAs installed does not support multi-process
   execution. Creating a context opens the device associated with the context
   and places a lock on it for that process. No other process may use that
   device. Some queries about the device through device.get_info<>() also
   open up the device and lock it to that process since the runtime needs
   to query the actual device to obtain that information.
 - The format of the object files produced by the compiler can change between
   versions. The workaround is to rebuild the application.
 - Using `sycl::program`/`sycl::kernel_bundle` API to refer to a kernel defined
   in another translation unit leads to undefined behavior
 - Linkage errors with the following message:
   `error LNK2005: "bool const std::_Is_integral<bool>" (??$_Is_integral@_N@std@@3_NB) already defined`
   can happen when a SYCL application is built using MS Visual Studio 2019
   version below 16.3.0 and user specifies `-std=c++14` or `/std:c++14`.
 - Printing internal defines isn't supported on Windows [50628db]

## Known issues
 - [new] Having MESA OpenCL implementation which provides no devices on a
   system may cause incorrect device discovery. As a workaround such an OpenCL
   implementation can be disabled by removing `/etc/OpenCL/vendor/mesa.icd`.
 - [new] Compilation may fail on Windows in debug mode if a kernel uses
   `std::array`.  This happens because debug version of `std::array` in
   Microsoft STL C++ headers calls functions that are illegal for the device
   code. As a workaround the following can be done:
    1. Dump compiler pipeline execution strings by passing `-###` option to the
       compiler. The compiler will print the internal execution strings of
       compilation tools. The actual compilation will not happen.
    2. Modify the (usually) first execution string (it should have
       `-fsycl-is-device` option) by adding
       `-D_CONTAINER_DEBUG_LEVEL=0 -D_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL=0` options to the
       end of the string.  Execute all string one by one.
 - [new] `-fsycl-dead-args-optimization` can't help eliminate offset of
   accessor even though it's created with no offset specified
 - [new] `cuMemPrefetchAsync` has issues on Windows. Hence, using
   `sycl::queue::prefetch` API on Windows might lead to failure [0c33048e4926]
 - SYCL 2020 barriers show worse performance than SYCL 1.2.1 do [18c80fa]
 - When using fallback assert in separate compilation flow it requires explicit
   linking against `lib/libsycl-fallback-cassert.o` or
   `lib/libsycl-fallback-cassert.spv`
 - Performance may be impacted by JIT-ing an extra 'copier' kernel and due
   running the 'copier' kernel and host-task after each kernel which uses
   assert
 - Limit alignment of allocation requests at 64KB which is the only alignment
   supported by Level Zero[7dfaf3bd]
 - On the following scenario on Level Zero backend:
    1. Kernel A, which uses buffer A, is submitted to queue A.
    2. Kernel B, which uses buffer B, is submitted to queue B.
    3. queueA.wait().
    4. queueB.wait().
   DPCPP runtime used to treat unmap/write commands for buffer A/B as host
   dependencies (i.e. they were waited for prior to enqueueing any command
   that's dependent on them). This allowed Level Zero plugin to detect that
   each queue is idle on steps 1/2 and submit the command list right away.
   This is no longer the case since we started passing these dependencies in an
   event waitlist and Level Zero plugin attempts to batch these commands, so
   the execution of kernel B starts only on step 4. The workaround restores the
   old behavior in this case until this is resolved [2023e10d][6c137f87].
 - User-defined functions with the name and signature matching those of any
   OpenCL C built-in function (i.e. an exact match of arguments, return type
   doesn't matter) can lead to Undefined Behavior.
 - A DPC++ system that has FPGAs installed does not support multi-process
   execution. Creating a context opens the device associated with the context
   and places a lock on it for that process. No other process may use that
   device. Some queries about the device through device.get_info<>() also
   open up the device and lock it to that process since the runtime needs
   to query the actual device to obtain that information.
 - The format of the object files produced by the compiler can change between
   versions. The workaround is to rebuild the application.
 - Using `sycl::program`/`sycl::kernel_bundle` API to refer to a kernel defined
   in another translation unit leads to undefined behavior
 - Linkage errors with the following message:
   `error LNK2005: "bool const std::_Is_integral<bool>" (??$_Is_integral@_N@std@@3_NB) already defined`
   can happen when a SYCL application is built using MS Visual Studio 2019
   version below 16.3.0 and user specifies `-std=c++14` or `/std:c++14`.
 - Printing internal defines isn't supported on Windows [50628db]

## Improvements
### SYCL Compiler
 - Added default device triple `spir64` when the compiler encounters any
   incoming object/libraries that have been built with the `spir64` target.

## API/ABI breakages
 - Removed `intel::reqd_work_group_size` attribute,
   `sycl::reqd_work_group_size` can be used instead [c583a20]

## Known issues
 - [new] SYCL 2020 barriers show worse performance than SYCL 1.2.1 do [18c80fa]
 - [new] When using fallback assert in separate compilation flow requires
   explicit, linking against `lib/libsycl-fallback-cassert.o` or
   `lib/libsycl-fallback-cassert.spv`
 - [new] Performance may be impacted by JIT-ing an extra 'copier' kernel and due
   running the 'copier' kernel and host-task after each kernel which uses
   assert
 - [new] Driver issue. When a two-step AOT build is used and there's at least a
   single call to devicelib function from within kernel, the device binary
   image gets corrupted
 - [new] Limit alignment of allocation requests at 64KB which is the only
   alignment supported by Level Zero[7dfaf3bd]
 - [new] On the following scenario on Level Zero backend:
    1. Kernel A, which uses buffer A, is submitted to queue A.
    2. Kernel B, which uses buffer B, is submitted to queue B.
    3. queueA.wait().
    4. queueB.wait().
   DPCPP runtime used to treat unmap/write commands for buffer A/B as host
   dependencies (i.e. they were waited for prior to enqueueing any command
   that's dependent on them). This allowed Level Zero plugin to detect that
   each queue is idle on steps 1/2 and submit the command list right away.
   This is no longer the case since we started passing these dependencies in an
   event waitlist and Level Zero plugin attempts to batch these commands, so
   the execution of kernel B starts only on step 4. The workaround restores the
   old behavior in this case until this is resolved [2023e10d][6c137f87].
 - User-defined functions with the name and signature matching those of any
   OpenCL C built-in function (i.e. an exact match of arguments, return type
   doesn't matter) can lead to Undefined Behavior.
 - A DPC++ system that has FPGAs installed does not support multi-process
   execution. Creating a context opens the device associated with the context
   and places a lock on it for that process. No other process may use that
   device. Some queries about the device through device.get_info<>() also
   open up the device and lock it to that process since the runtime needs
   to query the actual device to obtain that information.
 - The format of the object files produced by the compiler can change between
   versions. The workaround is to rebuild the application.
 - Using `sycl::program`/`sycl::kernel_bundle` API to refer to a kernel defined
   in another translation unit leads to undefined behavior
 - Linkage errors with the following message:
   `error LNK2005: "bool const std::_Is_integral<bool>" (??$_Is_integral@_N@std@@3_NB) already defined`
   can happen when a SYCL application is built using MS Visual Studio 2019
   version below 16.3.0 and user specifies `-std=c++14` or `/std:c++14`.
 - Printing internal defines isn't supported on Windows [50628db]

## API/ABI breakages
 - None

## Known issues
 - [new] The compiler generates a temporary source file which is used during
   host compilation.  This source file will appear to be a source dependency
   and could break build environments (such as Bazel) which closely keeps track
   of the generated files during a compilation. Build environments such as
   these will need to be configured in the DPC++ space to expect an additional
   intermediate file to be part of the compilation flow.
 - User-defined functions with the name and signature matching those of any
   OpenCL C built-in function (i.e. an exact match of arguments, return type
   doesn't matter) can lead to Undefined Behavior.
 - A DPC++ system that has FPGAs installed does not support multi-process
   execution. Creating a context opens the device associated with the context
   and places a lock on it for that process. No other process may use that
   device. Some queries about the device through device.get_info<>() also
   open up the device and lock it to that process since the runtime needs
   to query the actual device to obtain that information.
 - The format of the object files produced by the compiler can change between
   versions. The workaround is to rebuild the application.
 - Using `sycl::program`/`sycl::kernel_bundle` API to refer to a kernel defined
   in another translation unit leads to undefined behavior
 - Linkage errors with the following message:
   `error LNK2005: "bool const std::_Is_integral<bool>" (??$_Is_integral@_N@std@@3_NB) already defined`
   can happen when a SYCL application is built using MS Visual Studio 2019
   version below 16.3.0 and user specifies `-std=c++14` or `/std:c++14`.
 - Printing internal defines isn't supported on Windows [50628db]

## API/ABI breakages
- None

## Known issues
  - GlobalWorkOffset is not supported by Level Zero backend [6f9e9a76]
  - The code with function pointer is hanging on Level Zero [d384295e]
  - User-defined functions with the same name and signature (exact match of
    arguments, return type doesn't matter) as of an OpenCL C built-in
    function, can lead to Undefined Behavior.
  - A DPC++ system that has FPGAs installed does not support multi-process
    execution. Creating a context opens the device associated with the context
    and places a lock on it for that process. No other process may use that
    device. Some queries about the device through device.get_info<>() also
    open up the device and lock it to that process since the runtime needs
    to query the actual device to obtain that information.
  - On Windows, DPC++ compiler enforces using dynamic C++ runtime for
    application linked with SYCL library by:
     - linking with msvcrt[d].dll when `-fsycl` switch is used;
     - emitting an error on attempts to compile a program with static C++ RT
       using `-fsycl` and `/MT` or `/MTd`.
    That protects you from complicated runtime errors caused by C++ objects
    crossing sycl[d].dll boundary and not always handled properly by different
    versions of C++ RT used on app and sycl[d].dll sides.
  - The format of the object files produced by the compiler can change between
    versions. The workaround is to rebuild the application.
  - Using `cl::sycl::program` API to refer to a kernel defined in another
    translation unit leads to undefined behavior
  - Linkage errors with the following message:
    `error LNK2005: "bool const std::_Is_integral<bool>" (??$_Is_integral@_N@std@@3_NB) already defined`
    can happen when a SYCL application is built using MS Visual Studio 2019
    version below 16.3.0 and user specifies `-std=c++14` or `/std:c++14`.
  - Employing read sampler for image accessor may result in sporadic issues with
    Level Zero plugin/backend [2c50c03]
  - Printing internal defines isn't supported on Windows [50628db]
  - Group algorithms for MUL/AND/OR/XOR cannot be enabled for group scope due to
    SPIR-V limitations, and are not enabled for sub-group scope yet as the
    SPIR-V version isn't automatically raised from 1.1 to 1.3 [96da39e]
  - We cannot run Dead Argument Elimination for ESIMD since the pointers to SPIR
    kernel functions are saved in `!genx.kernels metadata` [cf10351]

  - The code with function pointer is hanging on Level Zero [d384295e]
  - User-defined functions with the same name and signature (exact match of
    arguments, return type doesn't matter) as of an OpenCL C built-in
    function, can lead to Undefined Behavior.
  - A DPC++ system that has FPGAs installed does not support multi-process
    execution. Creating a context opens the device associated with the context
    and places a lock on it for that process. No other process may use that
    device. Some queries about the device through device.get_info<>() also
    open up the device and lock it to that process since the runtime needs
    to query the actual device to obtain that information.
  - On Windows, DPC++ compiler enforces using dynamic C++ runtime for
    application linked with SYCL library by:
     - linking with msvcrt[d].dll when `-fsycl` switch is used;
     - emitting an error on attempts to compile a program with static C++ RT
       using `-fsycl` and `/MT` or `/MTd`.
    That protects you from complicated runtime errors caused by C++ objects
    crossing sycl[d].dll boundary and not always handled properly by different
    versions of C++ RT used on app and sycl[d].dll sides.
  - The format of the object files produced by the compiler can change between
    versions. The workaround is to rebuild the application.
  - Using `cl::sycl::program` API to refer to a kernel defined in another
    translation unit leads to undefined behavior
  - Linkage errors with the following message:
    `error LNK2005: "bool const std::_Is_integral<bool>" (??$_Is_integral@_N@std@@3_NB) already defined`
    can happen when a SYCL application is built using MS Visual Studio 2019
    version below 16.3.0 and user specifies `-std=c++14` or `/std:c++14`.
  - Employing read sampler for image accessor may result in sporadic issues with
    Level Zero plugin/backend [2c50c03]
  - Printing internal defines isn't supported on Windows [50628db]
  - Group algorithms for MUL/AND/OR/XOR cannot be enabled for group scope due to
    SPIR-V limitations, and are not enabled for sub-group scope yet as the
    SPIR-V version isn't automatically raised from 1.1 to 1.3 [96da39e]
  - We cannot run Dead Argument Elimination for ESIMD since the pointers to SPIR
    kernel functions are saved in `!genx.kernels metadata` [cf10351]

  - The SYCL library doesn't guarantee stable API/ABI, so applications compiled
    with older version of the SYCL library may not work with new one.
    The workaround is to rebuild the application.
    [ABI policy guide](doc/developer/ABIPolicyGuide.md)
  - Using `cl::sycl::program` API to refer to a kernel defined in another
    translation unit leads to undefined behavior

    `intelfpga::loop_coalesce`, `intelfpga::speculated_iterations`,
    `intelfpga::disable_loop_pipelining`, `intelfpga::max_interleaving`
    [73dd705][a5b9804]
  - Added support for `intel::reqd_work_group_size` attribute [8eb588d]
  - Added support for specialization constants feature which is based on
    [SYCL Specialization Constant proposal](https://github.com/codeplaysoftware/standards-proposals/blob/master/spec-constant/index.md) [29abe37]

## Improvements
### SYCL Frontend and driver changes
  - Added a diagnostic on attempt to declare or use non-const static variable
    inside device code [7743e86] [1853516]
  - Relaxed requirements for kernel types even more. Now by default they should
    have trivial copy constructor and trivial destructor [17aac3c]
  - Changed `std::numeric_limits<sycl::half>` to constexpr functions [85d7a5e]
  - Added a diagnostic on attempt to use zero length arrays inside device code
    [e6ce614]
  - Added support for math functions 'fabs' and 'ceil' in device code [f41309b]
  - Added a diagnostic (warning) on attempt to append new device object to
    an archive which already contains an AOT-compiled device object [9d348eb]
  - Added a diagnostic on attempt to use functions which have no definition in
    the TU and are not marked with `SYCL_EXTERNAL` macro inside device code
    [a3b340b]
  - Added a diagnostic on attempt to use thread local storage inside device code
    [eb373c4]
  - Removed arch designator from the default output file name when compiling
    with `-fsycl-link` option. Now an output file has just a flat name based on
    the first input file [dc729a7]
  - The SYCL headers were moved from `lib/clang/11.0.0/include` to
    `include/sycl` to support mixed compilers [39501f6]
  - Added support for the GCC style inline assembly in the device code [6f4e007]
  - Improved fat static library support: the driver now consider for offloading
    static libraries which are passed on the command line as well as libraries
    passed as part of the linker options. This effectively negates the need to
    use `-foffload-static-lib` and `-foffload-whole-static-lib` options which
    are deprecated now.
  - The `SYCL_EXTERNAL` macro is now allowed to be used with class member
    functions [3baec18]
  - Set `aux-target-cpu` for the device compilation which sets AVX and other
    necessary macro based on a target [f953fda]

### SYCL headers and runtime
  - Changed `sycl::context` and `sycl::queue` constructors to be explicit to
    avoid unintended conversions [c220eb8][3b6799a]
  - Added a diagnostic on setting `SYCL_DEVICE_TYPE` environment variable to an
    incorrect value [0125496]
  - Improved error codes which are encoded in the SYCL exceptions [04ee17c]
  - Removed functions that use float type in the fallback library for fp64
    complex [6ccd84a0]
  - Added support for `RESTRICT_WRITE_ACCESS_TO_CONSTANT_PTR` macro which allows
    to enable diagnostic on writing to a raw pointer obtained from a
    `sycl::constant_ptr` object [c9ed5b2]
  - Added support for USM extension for CUDA backend [498d56c]

### Documentation
  - Refactored [USM specification](doc/extensions/USM/USM.adoc) [0438422]
  - Added [GroupAlgorithms extensions](doc/extensions/GroupAlgorithms/)
    as replacement of GroupCollectives extension [c181fdb][b18a566]
  - Doxygen documentation is now rendered to GitHub Pages. An initial
    implementation is available [online](https://intel.github.io/llvm-docs/doxygen/annotated.html)
    [29d9cc2]
  - More details have been added about the `-fintelfpga` option in the
    [Compiler User Manual](doc/SYCLCompilerUserManual.md) [4b03ddb]
  - Added [SYCL_INTEL_enqueue_barrier extension document](doc/extensions/supported/sycl_ext_oneapi_enqueue_barrier.asciidoc)
    [6cfd2cb]
  - Added [standard layout relaxation extension](doc/extensions/RelaxStdLayout/SYCL_INTEL_relax_standard_layout.asciidoc)
    [ce53521]
  - Deprecated SubGroupNDRange extension [d9b178f]
  - Added extension for base sub-group class:
    [SubGroup](doc/extensions/deprecated/sycl_ext_oneapi_sub_group.asciidoc) [d9b178f]
  - Added extension for functions operating on sub-groups:
    [SubGroupAlgorithms](doc/extensions/deprecated/sycl_ext_oneapi_group_algorithms.asciidoc)
    [d9b178f]
  - Added extension introducing group masks and ballot functionality:
    [GroupMask](doc/extensions/supported/sycl_ext_oneapi_sub_group_mask.asciidoc)
    [d9b178f]
  - The project has been renamed to "oneAPI DPC++ Compiler", all documentation
    has been fixed accordingly [7a2e75e]

## Bug fixes
### SYCL Frontend and driver changes
  - Fixed a problem with compiler not being able to find a dependency file when
    compiling AOT to an object for FPGA [7b58b01]
  - Fixed a problem with host object not being added to the partial link step
    when compiling from source and using `-foffload-static-lib` option [1a951cb]
  - Reversed `reqd_work_group_size` attribute to match SYCL behavior [1da6fbe]
  - Fixed dependency output location when `/Fo<dir>` is given [2b6f4f4]
  - Fixed a crash which happened when no kernel name is passed to the
    `sycl::handler::parallel_for` [fadaa59]

### SYCL headers and runtime
  - Fixed `sycl::queue::wait()` which was not waiting for event associated with
    USM operation [850fb9f]
  - Fixed problem with reporting wrong error message on the second attempt to
    build program if the first attempt failed [9a34a11]
  - Fixed an issue which could happen when `sycl::event::wait` is called from
    multiple threads [3da5473]
  - Aligned `sub_group::store` signature between host and device [b3a9426]
  - Fixed `sycl::program::get_compile_options` and
    `sycl::program::get_build_options` to return correct values [03326f7]
  - Fixed `sycl::multi_ptr`'s methods that were incorrectly enabled/disabled on
    device/host [401d174]
  - Fixed incorrect dependency handling when creating sub-buffers which could
    lead to data races [45e39bd]
  - Reversed reported max work-group size for a device to align with work-group
    size reversing before kernels launch [72b7dee]
  - Fixed incorrect handling of kernels that use hierarchical parallelism when
    `-O0` option is passed to the clang [fd8ae8a]
  - Changed names of SYCL internal variables to avoid conflict with commonly
    used macros: `SUCCESS`, `BLOCKED` and `FAILED` [0f7e361]
  - Fixed a bug when a host device was always included in the device list
    returned by `sycl::device::get_devices` [6cf590f]
  - Fixed a problem with passing `sycl::vec` object to
    `sycl::group::async_work_group_copy` [20aa83e]
  - Fixed behavior of sycl::malloc_shared to return nullptr for the allocation
    size of zero or less byte, and the behavior of sycl::free functions to
    ignore the deallocation request from nullptr [d596593]
  - Fixed a possible problem with selecting work-group size which is bigger than
    max allowed work-group [b48f08f]
  - Fixed an issue which causes errors when using sub-buffers [5d1d716]
  - Changed the implementation of the buffer constructor from a pair of
    iterators. Now, data is not written back to the host on destruction of the
    buffer unless the buffer has a valid non-null pointer specified via the
    member function set_final_data [fb72758]
  - Fixed a problem with incorrect acceptance of a lambda which takes an
    argument of the `sycl::id` type in the `sycl::handler::parallel_for` version
    which takes a `sycl::ndrange` object [0408899]
  - Resolved circular dependency between `sycl::event` and `sycl::queue`
    [8c71dcb]


## Known issues
  - The format of the object files produced by the compiler can change between
    versions. The workaround is to rebuild the application.
  - The SYCL library doesn't guarantee stable API/ABI, so applications compiled
    with older version of the SYCL library may not work with new one.
    The workaround is to rebuild the application.
  - Using `cl::sycl::program` API to refer to a kernel defined in another
    translation unit leads to undefined behavior
  - Linkage errors with the following message:
    `error LNK2005: "bool const std::_Is_integral<bool>" (??$_Is_integral@_N@std@@3_NB) already defined`
    can happen when a SYCL application is built using MS Visual Studio 2019
    version below 16.3.0
    The workaround is to enable `-std=c++17` for the failing MSVC version.

## Bug fixes
### SYCL Frontend and driver changes
  - Fixed variable sharing passed by value to `parallel_for_work_group`

  - Fixed compilation of kernels which use `sycl::stream` for FPGA device
    [c4dbaa2]
  - Fixed execution graph cleanup on memory object destruction [7a75b54]

## Known issues
  - [new] Defining a `SUCCESS` or `FAILED` can break SYCL headers because such
    names are used internally
  - [new] The format of the object files produced by the compiler can change
    between versions. The workaround is to rebuild the application.
  - [new] The SYCL library doesn't guarantee stable API/ABI, so applications
    compiled with older version of the SYCL library may not work with new one.
    The workaround is to rebuild the application.
  - Using `cl::sycl::program` API to refer to a kernel defined in another
    translation unit leads to undefined behaviour
  - Linkage errors with the following message:
    `error LNK2005: "bool const std::_Is_integral<bool>" (??$_Is_integral@_N@std@@3_NB) already defined`
    can happen when a SYCL application is built using MS Visual Studio 2019
    version below 16.3.0
    The workaround is to enable `-std=c++17` for the failing MSVC version.

## Bug fixes
### SYCL Frontend and driver changes
  - Fixed a problem with option duplication during offload [1edd217]
  - Modified the driver to unbundle files with no extension like objects
    [84992a5]
  - Fixed AOT compilation for FPGA target on Windows [6b789f9] [525da51]
  - Fixed FPGA AOT compilation when using FPGA AOCX device archives
    [ec738f2] [16c530a]
  - Fixed problem causing abort when `-fsycl` and `-lstdc++` passed
    simultaneously [e437fd4]
  - Fixed `-o` option for FPGA AOT on Windows
    [ddd24a3]
  - Default `-std=c++` setting for device compilations was removed to avoid
    `__cplusplus` differences between host and device compilation. [29cabdf]
  - Suppressed warning about cdecl calling convention [0d2dab4]
  - Fixed problem when two different lambdas with the same signature get the
    same mangled name [d6aa11b]
  - Removed the error being issued for pseudo-destructor expressions [3c9006e]
  - Removed the device linking step for cases with no valid objects being
    provided from the device compilation [25bbe42]

### SYCL headers and runtime
  - Implemented a workaround for the issue with conversion of one element
    swizzle to a scalar [f752698]
  - Fixed a UX problem with a sycl::stream mixing output of several work-items
    in some cases [377b3fa]
  - Fixed problem with linker options getting passed to the bundler instead of
    the linker when -foffload-static-lib is supplied [e437fd4]
  - Fixed problem with using wrong offset inside `cl::sycl::handler::copy`
    [5c8e81f]
  - Fixed `get_count` and `get_size` methods of `cl::sycl::accessor` class that
    used to return incorrect values for non-local accessor created with range
    [9dd68c5]
  - Fixed issue with asynchronous exceptions not being associated with the
    returned event [6c512d3]
  - Fixed issue with host accessor not always providing exclusive access to
    a memory object [16ae15a]
  - Fixed issue with ignoring `cl::sycl::property::buffer::use_host_ptr`
    property [16ae15a]

## Known issues
- [new] `cl::sycl::program` constructor creates unnecessary context which is
  bound to the device which is chosen by `cl::sycl::default_selector`. This can
  lead to unexpected behavior, for example, process may hang if default selector
  chooses Intel FPGA emulator device but target device is Intel OpenCL CPU one
- [new] Using cl::sycl::program API to refer to a kernel defined in another
  translation unit leads to undefined behaviour
- [new] -fsycl-unnamed-lambda doesn't work with kernel names that contain
  cl::sycl::half type
- The addition of the static keyword on an array in the presence of Intel
  FPGA memory attributes results in the empty kernel after translation
- A loop's attribute in device code may be lost during compilation
- Linkage errors with the following message:
  `error LNK2005: "bool const std::_Is_integral<bool>" (??$_Is_integral@_N@std@@3_NB) already defined`
  can happen when a SYCL application is built using MS Visual Studio 2019
  version below 16.3.0
  For MSVC version having the error the workaround is to use -std=c++17 switch.

  - Added support for one-step compilation from source with `-fsycl-link`
    [55ebcae]
  - Enabled additional aoc options for dependency files input and output report
    [55ebcae]
  - Suppressed warning `"_declspec attribute 'dllexport' is not supported"`
    when run with `-fsycl`. Emit error when import function is called in the
    sycl kernel. [b10bdbb]
  - Changed `-fsycl-device-only` to override `-fsycl` option [d429243]
  - Added user-friendly diagnostic for unsupported math built-in functions usage
    in kernel [0476352]
  - The linking stage is now skipped if -fsycl-device-only option is passed
    [93178d1]
  - When unbundling static libraries on Windows, do not extract the host section
    as it is not being used. This fixes possible disk usage issues when working
    with fat static libraries [93ab97e]
  - Passing `-fsycl-help` with `-###` option now prints the actual call to tool
    being made. [8b8bfa9]
  - Allow for `-gN` to override default setting with `-fintelfpga` [3b20615]
  - Update sub-group reduce/scan syntax [cd8194d]
  - Prevent libraries from being considered for unbundling on Windows [3438a48]
  - Improved Windows behaviors for calling `lib.exe` when creating an archive
    for Intel FPGA AOT [e7afcb1]

### SYCL headers and runtime
  - Removed suppression of exceptions thrown by async_handler from
    `cl::sycl::queue` destructor [61574d8]
  - Added the support for output operator for half data types [6a2cd90]
  - Improved efficiency of stream output of `cl::sycl::h_item` for Intel FPGA
    device [80e97a0]

  - Reversed mapping of SYCL range/ID dimensions to OpenCL, to provide expected
    performance through unit stride dimension. The highest dimension in SYCL
    (e.g. r2 in cl::sycl::range<3> R(r0,r1,r2)) now maps to the lowest dimension
    in OpenCL (e.g. an enqueue of size_t[3] cl_R = {r2,r1,r0}). The same applies
    to range and ID queries, in kernels defined through OpenCL interop.
    [40aa3f9]
  - Added support for constructing `cl::sycl::image` without host ptr but with
    pitch provided [d1931fd]

    This library should be used when SYCL application is compiled with `/MDd`
    option to avoid ABI issues [71a75c0]
  - Added driver and runtime support for AOT-compiled images for multiple
    devices.  This handles the case when the device code is AOT-compiled for
    multiple targets [0d4eb49] [bcf38cf]

  specifying "Kernel Name" type. This can be enabled by passing
  `-fsycl-unnamed-lambda` option.
- Kernel to kernel blocking and non-blocking pipe feature is implemented.
- Added support for Unified Shared Memory ([USM](doc/extensions/USM)).

## Improvements

  library instead of libstdc++.
- Adjusted array and vec classes so they are more efficient for Intel FPGA
  devices.
- Exception will be thrown on attempt to create image accessor for the device
  which doesn't support images.
- Use `llvm-objcopy` for merging device and host objects instead of doing
  partial linking.
- Check if online compiler is available before building the program.
- clCreateProgramWithILKHR is used if OpenCL implementation supports
  cl_khr_il_program extension.
- Reuse the pointer provided by the user in the `buffer` constructor (even if
  `use_host_ptr` property isn't specified) if its alignment is sufficient.
- `-Ldir` now can be used to find libraries with `-foffload-static-lib`
- `max_concurrency` Intel FPGA loop attribute now accepts zero.
- Ignore incorrectly used Intel FPGA loop attribute emitting user friendly
  warning instead of compiler error.
- Added `depends_on` methods of `handler` class which can be used to provide
  additional dependency for a command group.
- SYCL implementation can now be built on Windows using Visual Studio 2017 or
  higher.

## Bug fixes
- Fixed assertion failure when use `-save-temps` option along with `-fsycl`.
- Cached JITed programs are now released during destruction of `context` they
  are bound to, earlier release happened during a process shutdown.
- Fixed `get_linear_id` method of `group` class, now it calculate according to
  row-major ordering.
- Removed printing of error messages to stderr before throwing an exception.
- Explicit copy API of the handler class is asynchronous again.
- `fill` method of `handler` class now takes element size into account.
- Fixed bug with ignored several Intel FPGA loop attributes in case of argument
  is 1.

- Fixed problem which caused invalid/redundant memory copy operations to be
  generated.
- The commands created by Scheduler now cleaned up on destruction of
  corresponding `SYCL` memory objects (`buffer`, `image`).
- 1 dimensional sub buffer is passed as cl_mem obtained by calling
  clCreateSubBuffer when kernel is built from OpenCL C source.
- Now copy of entire memory is performed when data is needed in new context even
  if user requests accesses to only part of the memory.
- Fixed problem with one element `vec` objects relation/logical operation which
  was working like scalar.
- Type casting and conditional operator (ternary 'if') with pointers now working
  correctly.
- The problem with calling inlined kernel from multiple TUs is fixed.
- Fixed compiler warnings for Intel FPGA attributes on host compilation.
- Fixed bug with passing values of `vec<#, half>` type to the kernel.
- Fixed buffer constructor which takes host data as shared_ptr. Now it
  increments shared_ptr reference counter and reuses provided memory if
  possible.
- Fixed a bug with nd_item.barrier not respecting fence_space flag

# July'19 release notes

Release notes for commit 64c0262c0f0b9e1b7b2e2dcef57542a3fe3bdb97.

## New features
 - `cl::sycl::stream` class support has been added.
 - New attributes for Intel FPGA device are added: `merge`, `max_replicates`
   and `simple_dual_port`.
 - Initial support for new Plugin Interface (PI) layer is added to SYCL runtime
   library. This feature simplifies porting SYCL implementation to non-OpenCL
   APIs.
 - New address space handling rules are implemented in the SYCL device
   compiler. Raw pointers are allocated in generic address space by default and
   address space inference is supposed to be done by LLVM pass.  Old compiler
   behavior can be recovered by enabling `DISABLE_INFER_AS` environment
   variable.
 - Add basic implementation of hierarchical parallelism API.
 - Add new clang built-in function `__unique_stable_name`. SYCL compiler may
   use this built-in function to auto-generate SYCL kernel name for lambdas.

## Improvements
 - SYCL integration header is excluded from the dependency list.
 - Raw pointers capturing added to the SYCL device front-end compiler. This
   capability is required for Unified Shared Memory feature implementation.
 - SYCL device compiler enabled support for OpenCL types like event, sampler,
   images to simplify compilation of the SYCL code to SPIR-V format.
   `CXXReflower` pass used to make "SPIR-V friendly LLVM IR" has been removed.
 - Intel FPGA loop attributes were renamed to avoid potential name conflicts.
 - Old scheduler has been removed.
 - `sampler` type support is added to the `set_arg` methods.
 - Internal SYCL device compiler design documentation was improved and updated.
   Development process documentation has been updated with more details.
 - Initial support for `image` class (w/o accessor support).
 - Static variables are allocated in global address space now.
 - Made sub-group methods constant to enable more use cases.
 - Added `-fsycl-link` option to generate fat object "linkable" as regular host
   object.
 - Enable `set_final_data` method with `shared_ptr` parameter.
 - Enable using of the copy method with `shared_ptr` with `const T`.

## Bug fixes
 - Fixed argument size calculation for zero-dimensional accessor.
 - Removed incorrect source correlation from kernel instructions leading to
   incorrect profiling and debug information.
 - A number of issues were fixed breaking build of the compiler on Windows
 - Fixed unaligned access in load and store methods of the vector class.
 - `global_mem_cache_type` values were aligned with the latest revision of the
   SYCL specification.
 - Stubs for C++ standard headers were removed. This should fix compilation of
   <iostream> and <algorithm> with SYCL device compiler.
 - Unscoped enums were removed from global namespace to avoid conflicts with
   user defined symbols.
 - Explicit copy API of the handler class is blocking i.e. data is
   copied once the command group has completed execution.
 - Renamed `cl::sycl::group::get_linear` to `cl::sycl::group::get_linear_id`.
 - SYCL kernel constructor from OpenCL handle now retains OpenCL object during
   SYCL object lifetime.
 - Fixed forward declaration compilation inside a SYCL kernel.
 - Fixed code generation for 3-element boolean vectors.

## Prerequisites
 - Experimental Intel(R) CPU Runtime for OpenCL(TM) Applications with SYCL
   support is available now and recommended OpenCL CPU RT prerequisite for the
   SYCL compiler.
 - The Intel(R) Graphics Compute Runtime for OpenCL(TM) version 19.25.13237 is
   recommended OpenCL GPU RT prerequisite for the SYCL compiler.

## Known issues
 - New address space handling approach might degrade compilation time
   (especially for GPU device).
 - Some tests might fail on CPU device with the [first experimental CPU
   runtime](https://github.com/intel/llvm/tree/expoclcpu-1.0.0) due to new
   address space handling by the SYCL compiler. The workaround for this kind of
   issues while we wait for CPU runtime update is to set `DISABLE_INFER_AS`
   environment variable during compilation. See
   https://github.com/intel/llvm/issues/277 for more details.

# June'19 release notes

The release notes contain information about changes that were done after
previous release notes and up to commit
d404d1c6767524c21b9c5d05f11b89510abc0ab9.

## New Features
- New FPGA loop attributes supported:
    - `intelfpga::ivdep(Safelen)`
    - `intelfpga::ii(Interval)`
    - `intelfpga::max_concurrency(NThreads)`

## Improvements
- The new scheduler is implemented with the following improvements:
    - optimize host memory allocation for `buffer` objects.
    - optimize data transfer between host and device by using Map/Unmap instead
      of Read/Write for 1D accessors.
    - simultaneous read from a buffer is allowed: execution of two kernels
      reading from the same buffer are not serialized anymore.
- Memory attribute `intelfpga::max_concurrency` was renamed to
  `intelfpga::max_private_copies` to avoid name conflict with fresh added loop
  attribute
- Added support for const values and local accessors in `handler::set_arg`
  method.

## Bug Fixes
- The new scheduler is implemented with the following bug fixes:
    - host accessor now blocks subsequent operations(except RAR) with the buffer
      it provides accesses to until it is destroyed.
    - OpenCL buffers now released on the buffer destruction.
- `accessor::operator[]` like methods now take into account offset.
- Non-SYCL compilation(without `-fsycl`) was fixed, such application should work
  on host device, but fail on OpenCL devices.
- Several warnings were cleaned up.
- buffer constructor was fixed to support const type as template parameter.
- `event::get_profiling_info` now waits for event to be completed.
- Removed non-const overload of `item::operator[]` as it's not present in SYCL
  specification.
- Compiling multiple objects when using `-fsycl-link-targets` now creates proper
  final .spv binary.
- Fixed bug with crash in sampler destructor when sampler object is created
  using enumerations.
- Fixed `handler::set_arg`, so now it works correctly with kernels created using
  program constructor which takes `cl_program` or `program::build_with_source`.
- Now `lgamma_r` builtin works correctly when application is built without
  specifying `-fsycl` option to the compiler.

## Prerequisites
- Experimental Intel® CPU Runtime for OpenCL™ Applications with SYCL support is
  available now and recommended OpenCL CPU RT prerequisite for the SYCL
  compiler.
- The Intel(R) Graphics Compute Runtime for OpenCL(TM) version 19.21.13045 is
  recomended OpenCL GPU RT prerequisite for the SYCL compiler.

## Known issues
- Performance regressions can happen due to additional math for calculation of
  offset that were added to the `accessor::operator[]` like methods.
- Applications can hang at exit when running on OpenCL CPU device because some
  OpenCL handles allocated inside SYCL(e.g. `cl_command_queue`) are not
  released.

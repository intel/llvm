# May'19 release notes

## New Features
- Added support for half type.
- Implemented sampler class.

## Improvements
- Implemented several methods of buffer class:
    - buffer::has_property and buffer::get_property
    - buffer::get_access with range and offset classes
    - buffer::get_allocator as well as overall support for custom allocators.
- Implemented broadcasting vec::operator=.
- Added support for creating a sub-buffer from a SYCL buffer.
- Added diagnostic about capturing class static variable in kernel code.
- Added support for discard_write access::mode.
- Now SYCL buffer allocates 64 bytes aligned memory.
- Added support for case when object of accessor class is wrapped by some class.
- Added support for const void specialization of multi_ptr class.
- Implemented the following groups of SYCL built-in functions:
    - integers
    - geometric
- Support for variadic templates in SYCL kernel names.

## Bug Fixes
- Disabled several methods of buffer class that were available for incompatible
  number of dimensions.
- Added initialization of range field in buffer interoperability constructor.
- Fixed buffer constructor with iterators, now the data is written back to the
  input iterator if it's not const iterator.
- Fixed the problem which didn't allow using buffer::set_final_data and creating
  of host accessor from buffer created using interoperability constructor.
- Now program::get_*_options returns options correctly if the program is created
  with interoperability constructor.
- Fixed linking multiple programs compiled using compile_with_kernel_type.
- Fixed initialization of device list in program class interoperability
  constructor.
- Aligned vec class with the SYCL Specification, changed argument to multi_ptr
  with const type.
- Fixed queue profiling device information query to work with OpenCL1.2.

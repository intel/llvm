# June'19 release notes

The release notes contain information about changes that were done after
previous release notes and up to commit
d404d1c6767524c21b9c5d05f11b89510abc0ab9.

## New Features
- New FPGA loop attributes supported:
    - `intelfpga::ivdep(Safelen)`
    - `intelfpga::ii(Interval)`
    - `intelfpga::max_concurrency(NThreads)`

## Improvements
- The new scheduler is implemented with the following improvements:
    - optimize host memory allocation for `buffer` objects.
    - optimize data transfer between host and device by using Map/Unmap instead
      of Read/Write for 1D accessors.
    - simultaneous read from a buffer is allowed: execution of two kernels
      reading from the same buffer are not serialized anymore.
- Memory attribute `intelfpga::max_concurrency` was renamed to
  `intelfpga::max_private_copies` to avoid name conflict with fresh added loop
  attribute
- Added support for const values and local accessors in `handler::set_arg` method.

## Bug Fixes
- The new scheduler is implemented with the following bug fixes:
    - host accessor now blocks subsequent operations(except RAR) with the buffer
      it provides accesses to until it is destroyed.
    - OpenCL buffers now released on the buffer destruction.
- `accessor::operator[]` like methods now take into account offset.
- Non-SYCL compilation(without `-fsycl`) was fixed, such application should work
  on host device, but fail on OpenCL devices.
- Several warnings were cleaned up.
- buffer constructor was fixed to support const type as template parameter.
- `event::get_profiling_info` now waits for event to be completed.
- Removed non-const overload of `item::operator[]` as it's not present in SYCL
  specification.
- Compiling multiple objects when using `-fsycl-link-targets` now creates proper
  final .spv binary.
- Fixed bug with crash in sampler destructor when sampler object is created using
  enumerations.
- Fixed `handler::set_arg`, so now it works correctly with kernels created using
  program constructor which takes `cl_program` or `program::build_with_source`.
- Now `lgamma_r` builtin works correctly when application is built without
  specifying `-fsycl` option to the compiler.

## Prerequisites
- Experimental Intel® CPU Runtime for OpenCL™ Applications with SYCL support is
  available now and recommended OpenCL CPU RT prerequisite for the SYCL
  compiler.
- The Intel(R) Graphics Compute Runtime for OpenCL(TM) version 19.21.13045 is
  recomended OpenCL GPU RT prerequisite for the SYCL compiler.

## Known issues
- Performance regressions can happen due to additional math for calculation of
  offset that were added to the `accessor::operator[]` like methods.
- Applications can hang at exit when running on OpenCL CPU device because some
  OpenCL handles allocated inside SYCL(e.g. `cl_command_queue`) are not
  released.


# May'19 release notes

## New Features
- Added support for half type.
- Implemented sampler class.

## Improvements
- Implemented several methods of buffer class:
    - buffer::has_property and buffer::get_property
    - buffer::get_access with range and offset classes
    - buffer::get_allocator as well as overall support for custom allocators.
- Implemented broadcasting vec::operator=.
- Added support for creating a sub-buffer from a SYCL buffer.
- Added diagnostic about capturing class static variable in kernel code.
- Added support for discard_write access::mode.
- Now SYCL buffer allocates 64 bytes aligned memory.
- Added support for case when object of accessor class is wrapped by some class.
- Added support for const void specialization of multi_ptr class.
- Implemented the following groups of SYCL built-in functions:
    - integers
    - geometric
- Support for variadic templates in SYCL kernel names.

## Bug Fixes
- Disabled several methods of buffer class that were available for incompatible
  number of dimensions.
- Added initialization of range field in buffer interoperability constructor.
- Fixed buffer constructor with iterators, now the data is written back to the
  input iterator if it's not const iterator.
- Fixed the problem which didn't allow using buffer::set_final_data and creating
  of host accessor from buffer created using interoperability constructor.
- Now program::get_*_options returns options correctly if the program is created
  with interoperability constructor.
- Fixed linking multiple programs compiled using compile_with_kernel_type.
- Fixed initialization of device list in program class interoperability
  constructor.
- Aligned vec class with the SYCL Specification, changed argument to multi_ptr
  with const type.
- Fixed queue profiling device information query to work with OpenCL1.2.

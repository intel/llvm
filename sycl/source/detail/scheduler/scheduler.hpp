/// \defgroup sycl_graph DPC++ Execution Graph
///
/// SYCL, unlike OpenCL, provides a programming model in which the user doesn't
/// need to manage dependencies between kernels and memory explicitly. The DPC++
/// Runtime must ensure correct execution with respect to the order commands are
/// submitted.
///
/// This document describes the part of the DPC++ Runtime that is responsible
/// for building and processing dependency graph.
///
/// ## A couple of words about DPC++ and SYCL execution and memory model
///
/// The SYCL framework defines command group (\ref CG) as an entity that
/// represents minimal execution block. The command group is submitted to SYCL
/// queue and consists of a kernel or an explicit memory operation, and their
/// requirements. The SYCL queue defines the device and context using which the
/// kernel should be executed.
///
/// The commands that contain explicit memory operations include copy, fill,
/// update_host and other operations. It's up to implementation how to define
/// these operations.
///
/// The relative order of command groups submission defines the order in which
/// kernels must be executed if their memory requirements intersect. For
/// example, if a command group A writes to a buffer X, command group B reads
/// from X, then the scheduled execution order of A and B will be the same as
/// their dynamic submission order (matches program order if submitted from the
/// same host thread).
///
/// Memory requirements are requests to SYCL memory objects, such as buffer and
/// image. SYCL memory objects are not bound to any specific context or device,
/// it's SYCL responsibility to allocate and/or copy memory to the target
/// context to achieve correct execution.
///
/// Refer to SYCL Specification 1.2.1 sections 3.4 and 3.5 to find more
/// information about SYCL execution and memory model.
///
/// ### Example of DPC++ application
///
/// \code{.cpp}
/// {
///   // Creating SYCL CPU and GPU queues
///   cl::sycl::queue CPU_Queue = ...;
///   cl::sycl::queue GPU_Queue = ...;
///
///   // Creating 3 SYCL buffers
///   auto BufferA = ...; // Buffer is initialized with host memory.
///   auto BufferB = ...;
///   auto BufferC = ...;
///
///   // "Copy command group" section
///   // Request processing explicit copy operation on CPU
///   // The copy operation reads from BufferA and writes to BufferB
///
///   CPU_Queue.submit([&](handler &CGH) {
///     auto A = BufferA.get_access<read>(CGH);
///     auto B = BufferB.get_access<write>(CGH);
///     CGH.copy(A, B);
///   });
///
///   // "Multi command group" section
///   // Request processing multi kernel on GPU
///   // The kernel reads from BufferB, multiplies by 4 and writes result to
///   // BufferC
///
///   GPU_Queue.submit([&](handler &CGH) {
///     auto B = BufferB.get_access<read>(CGH);
///     auto C = BufferC.get_access<write>(CGH);
///     CGH.parallel_for<class multi>(range<1>{N}, [=](id<1> Index) {
///       C[Index] = B[Index] * 4;
///     });
///   });
///
///   // "Host accessor creation" section
///   // Request the latest data of BufferC for the moment
///   // This is a synchronization point, which means that the DPC++ RT blocks
///   // on creation of the accessor until requested data is available.
///   auto C = BufferC.get_access<read>();
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// In the example above the DPC++ RT does the following:
///
/// 1. **Copy command group**.
///    The DPC++ RT allocates memory for BufferA and BufferB on CPU then
///    executes an explicit copy operation on CPU.
///
/// 2. **Multi command group**
///    DPC++ RT allocates memory for BufferC and BufferB on GPU and copy
///    content of BufferB from CPU to GPU, then execute "multi" kernel on GPU.
///
/// 3. **Host accessor creation**
///    DPC++ RT allocates(it's possible to reuse already allocated memory)
///    memory available for user for BufferC then copy content of BufferC from
///    GPU to this memory.
///

/// \code{.cpp}
/// // Initialization(not related to the Scheduler)

/// DPC++ graph scheduler class.
///
/// \section sched_overview Scheduler Overview
///
/// The Scheduler is a part of DPC++ RT which ensures correct execution of
/// command groups. To achieve this Scheduler manages acyclic dependency graph
/// (which can have independent sub-graphs) that consists of several types of
/// nodes that represent specific commands:
///
/// 1. Allocate memory.
///    The command represents memory allocation operation. There can be
///    multiple allocations for a single SYCL memory object.
/// 2. Release memory.
///    The command represents memory release operation.
/// 3. Execute command group.
///    The command represents \ref CG "Command Group" (kernel) execution
///    operation.
/// 4. Copy memory.
///    The command represents memory copy operation between two memory
///    allocations of a single memory object.
///
/// As the main input Scheduler takes a command group and returns an event
/// representing it, so it can be waited on later. When a new
/// command group comes, Scheduler adds one or more nodes to the graph
/// depending on the command groups' requirements. For example, if a new
/// command group is submitted to the SYCL context which has the latest data
/// for all the requirements, Scheduler adds a new "Execute command group"
/// command making it dependent on all commands affecting new command group's
/// requirements. But if one of the requirements has no up-to-date instance in
/// the context which the command group is submitted to, Scheduler
/// additionally inserts copy memory command (together with allocate memory
/// command if needed).
///
/// A simple graph looks like:
//
//    +----------+     +----------+     +----------+
//    |          |     |          |     |          |
//    | Allocate |<----| Execute  |<----| Execute  |
//    |          |     |          |     |          |
//    +----------+     +----------+     +----------+
//
/// \dot
/// digraph G {
///   rankdir="LR";
///   Execute1 [label = "Execute"];
///   Execute2 [label = "Execute"];
///   Allocate;
///   Allocate -> Execute2 [dir = back];
///   Execute2 -> Execute1 [dir = back];
/// }
/// \enddot
///
/// Where nodes represent commands and edges represent dependencies between
/// them. There are three commands connected by arrows which mean that before
/// executing second command group the first one must be executed. Also before
/// executing the first command group memory allocation must be performed.
///
/// At some point Scheduler enqueues commands to the underlying devices. To do
/// this, Scheduler performs topological sort to get the order in which commands
/// should be enqueued. For example, the following graph (D depends on B and C,
/// B and C depends on A) will be enqueued in the following order:
/// \code{.cpp}
///   EventA = Enqueue(A, /*Deps=*/{});
///   EventB = Enqueue(B, /*Deps=*/{EventA});
///   EventC = Enqueue(C, /*Deps=*/{EventA});
///   EventD = Enqueue(D, /*Deps=*/{EventB, EventC});
/// \endcode

/// \section sched_impl Implementation details
///
/// The Scheduler is split up into two parts: graph builder and graph processor.
///
/// To build dependencies, Scheduler needs to memorize memory objects and
/// commands that modify them.
///
/// To detect that two command groups access the same memory object and create
/// a dependency between them, Scheduler needs to store information about
/// the memory object.
///
/// \subsection sched_thread_safety Thread safety
///
/// To ensure thread safe execution of methods, Scheduler provides access to the
/// graph that's guarded by a read-write mutex (analog of shared mutex from
/// C++17).
///
/// A read-write mutex allows concurrent access to read-only operations, while
/// write operations require exclusive access.
///
/// All the methods of GraphBuilder lock the mutex in write mode because these
/// methods can modify the graph.
/// Methods of GraphProcessor lock the mutex in read mode as they are not
/// modifying the graph.
///
/// \subsection shced_err_handling Error handling
///
/// There are two sources of errors that needs to be handled in Scheduler:
/// 1. errors that happen during command enqueue process
/// 2. the error that happend during command execution.
///
/// If an error occurs during command enqueue process, the Command::enqueue
/// method returns the faulty command. Scheduler then reschedules the command
/// and all dependent commands (if any).
///
/// An error with command processing can happen in underlying runtime, in this
/// case Scheduler is notified asynchronously (using callback mechanism) what
/// triggers rescheduling.

  ///
  /// Commands are enqueued whenever they come to the Scheduler. Each command
  /// has enqueue method which takes vector of events that represents
  /// dependencies and returns event which represents the command.
  /// GraphProcessor performs topological sort to get the order in which
  /// commands have to be enqueued. Then it enqueues each command, passing a
  /// vector of events that this command needs to wait on. If an error happens
  /// during command enqueue, the whole process is stopped, the faulty command
  /// is propagated back to the Scheduler.
  ///
  /// The command with dependencies that belong to a context different from its
  /// own can't be enqueued directly (limitation of OpenCL runtime).
  /// Instead, for each dependency, a proxy event is created in the target
  /// context and linked using OpenCL callback mechanism with original one.
  /// For example, the following SYCL code:
  ///
  /// \code{.cpp}
  ///   // The ContextA and ContextB are different OpenCL contexts
  ///   sycl::queue Q1(ContextA);
  ///   sycl::queue Q2(ContextB);
  ///
  ///   Q1.submit(Task1);
  ///
  ///   Q2.submit(Task2);
  /// \endcode
  ///
  /// is translated to the following OCL API calls:
  ///
  /// \code{.cpp}
  ///   void event_completion_callback(void *data) {
  ///     // Change status of event to complete.
  ///     clSetEventStatus((cl_event *)data, CL_COMPLETE); // Scope of Context2
  ///   }
  ///
  ///  // Enqueue TASK1
  ///  EventTask1 = clEnqueueNDRangeKernel(Q1, TASK1, ..); // Scope of Context1
  ///  // Read memory to host
  ///  ReadMem = clEnqueueReadBuffer(A, .., /*Deps=*/EventTask1); // Scope of
  ///  // Context1
  ///
  ///  // Create user event with initial status "not completed".
  ///  UserEvent = clCreateUserEvent(Context2); // Scope of Context2
  ///  // Ask OpenCL to call callback with UserEvent as data when "read memory
  ///  // to host" operation is completed
  ///  clSetEventCallback(ReadMem, event_completion_callback,
  ///                     /*data=*/UserEvent); // Scope of Context1
  ///
  ///  // Enqueue write memory from host, block it on user event
  ///  // It will be unblocked when we change UserEvent status to completed in
  ///  // callback.
  ///  WriteMem =
  ///     clEnqueueWriteBuffer(A, .., /*Dep=*/UserEvent); // Scope of Context2
  ///  // Enqueue TASK2
  ///  EventTask2 =
  ///     clEnqueueNDRangeKernel(TASK, .., /*Dep=*/WriteMem); // Scope of
  ///     // Context2
  /// \endcode
  ///
  /// The alternative approach that has been considered is to have separate
  /// dispatcher thread that would wait for all events from the Context other
  /// then target Context to complete and then enqueue command with dependencies

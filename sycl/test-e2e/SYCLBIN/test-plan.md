                                        const sycl::span<char>& bytes,
                                        PropertyListT props = {});

    template<bundle_state State, typename PropertyListT = empty_properties_t>
    kernel_bundle<State> get_kernel_bundle(const context& ctxt,
                                        const std::vector<device>& devs,

       compatible with at least one device from `devs`

       devs vector is empty

    9. Check an exception with the `errc::build` error code is thrown if
       `State` is `bundle_state::object` or `bundle_state::executable`, if the
       implementation needs to perform an online compile, and if the online
       compile fails (unit test)
    10. Check an exception with the `errc::build` error code is thrown if
       `State` is `bundle_state::object` or `bundle_state::executable`, if the

    2. Verify that a kernel created from a kernel bundle generated from SYCLBIN 
       files works correctly with device globals
    1. Verify that when using two kernels, each kernel created from a kernel
       bundle generated from SYCLBIN files maintains its own independent set of
       device globals

       correctly in a kernel created from a kernel bundle generated from SYCLBIN
       files

       files, link correctly with each other
    2. Verify that two kernel bundles in the `object` state, generated from SYCLBIN
       files, link correctly with each other

       optimization levels (e.g., `-O0` vs. `-O1`), link correctly with each other
    3. Verify that two kernel bundles in the `object` state, compiled with different 
       optimization levels (e.g., `-O0` vs. `-O1`), link correctly with each other

       runtime-compiled (e.g., a SYCL_EXTERNAL kernel) and the other is compiled from
       a SYCLBIN file

       pipeline is skipped
    3. Check when `-fsyclbin` is set, output is a file with the .syclbin file
       extension
    4. Check when `-fsyclbin` is set, `clang-linker-wrapper` has `--syclbin`
       flag
    5. Check when `-fsyclbin` is not set, `clang-linker-wrapper` has no `--syclbin`
       flag
    6. Check when `-fsycl-device-only` and `-fsyclbin` are used,
       `-fsycl-device-only` is unused
    7. Check `-fsycl-link` works without any errors with .syclbin files. TODO:
       figure out that
    8. Check that `--offload-rdc` is an alias to `-fgpu-rdc`

    1. Check when `--syclbin` is used, module-splitting is performed
    2. Check when `--syclbin` is used, `clang-linker-wrapper` skips wrapping of
       the device code and the host code linking stage

 10. Tests for SYCL runtime library

    1. Validate SYCL RT correctly parses SYCLBIN file (e.g., magic number is
       correct, etc.). Check correctness of corresponding data structure. Test
       should expect that SYCLBIN version is 1.
    2. Validate SYCL RT correctly writes SYCLBIN object to SYCLBIN file. Test
       should expect that SYCLBIN version is 1.
    3. Generate SYCLBIN files with JIT and AOT compilation. For each mode test
       that SYCL RT correctly parses input SYCLBIN properies in binary format:
       SYCLBIN/global metadata, SYCLBIN/ir module metadata, SYCLBIN/native
       device code image metadata. `sycl-dump` tool can be used

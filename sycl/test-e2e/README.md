# Overview
This directory contains SYCL-related tests distributed in subdirectories based
on testing scope. They follow the same style as other LIT tests but have a minor
but crucial difference in the behavior of certain directives.

First, some background. SYCL end-to-end tests take much longer to compile
than they spend executing on a device. As such, we want to be able to
structure the test in such a way that we compile it once and then execute
multiple times on different devices (via `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR`) to get
required test coverage. The issue here is that the standard approach to `RUN`
directives and substitutions doesn't allow us to expand a line into only
dynamically known number of commands.

To overcome that, we introduce `%{run}` *expansion* that generates multiple
commands from a single `RUN` directive - one per device in `sycl_devices`
parameter (more on the parameter below). There is a small number of tests that
either need multiple devices or target the device selector itself. For such
tests we have a regular `%{run-unfiltered-devices}` substitution that doesn't
set a `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR` filter nor does it create multiple commands.
Technically, this change is implemented by creating a custom LIT test
[format](/sycl/test-e2e/format.py) that inherits from `lit.formats.ShTest`.

This custom LIT test format also overrides the meaning of
`REQUIRES`/`UNSUPPORTED`/`XFAIL` directives, although in a natural way that
suits the `%{run}` expansion described above. First, "features" are split into
device independent (e.g. "linux" or "cuda_dev_kit") and device dependent
("cpu/gpu/accelerator", "opencl/cuda/hip/level_zero" and multiple "aspect-\*").
Second, for each device in `sycl_devices` LIT parameter, we check if it satisfies
the conditions in `UNSUPPORTED`/`REQUIRES` rules. If none of the devices do,
the entire test is skipped as `UNSUPPORTED`. Otherwise, if multiple such devices
are supported we do an additional filtering treating any `XFAIL` directives same
way as `UNSUPPORTED`. If only one device is matched by `UNSUPPORTED`/`REQUIRES`
filtering, then `XFAIL` behaves as an actual "expected to fail" marking.

For any device left after the filtering above we expand each `RUN` directive
(including multi-line ones) containing `%{run}` expansion into one command per
device, replacing `%{run}` with

```
env ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=<device_matching_requirements> [Optional run_launcher if that is configured]
```

 while at the same time properly handling `%if` conditions,
meaning that the following works as one would expect it to behave:

```
// RUN: %run %t.out %if cpu %{ 1 %} %else %{ 2 %}`. `%{run-unfiltered-devices}
```
is substituted with just `[Optional run_launcher if that is configured]`.

Another little nuance is `%{sycl_triple}` substitution. It is constructed by
concatenating triples for all the devices from `sycl_devices` supported by a
given test. After that there is also a convenient `%{build}` substitution that
is equivalent to `%clangxx -fsycl -fsycl-targets=%{sycl_triple} %s`.

# Prerequisites

 - Target runtime(s) to execute tests on devices. See
   [installation instructions](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/sycl/sycl/doc/GetStartedGuide.md#install-low-level-runtime)
 - DPC++ compiler. Can be built following these
   [instructions](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/sycl/sycl/doc/GetStartedGuide.md#build-dpc-toolchain)
   or taken prebuilt from [releases](https://github.com/intel/llvm/releases).
 - LIT tools (llvm-lit, llvm-size). They are not available at prebuilts above,
   but can be built in compiler project (e.g. with "ninja check").
   
Last two bullets are only needed for a standalone configuration. During a normal
development workflow the tests are integrated into a normal project
build/configuration.

# Developers workflow
Just build the project according to [Getting Started
Guide](/sycl/doc/GetStartedGuide.md) and setup your environment per [Run simple
DPC++ application
Instructions](/sycl/doc/GetStartedGuide.md#run-simple-dpc-application).
Then use

```
# Either absolute or relative path will work.
llvm-lit <repo_path>/sycl/test-e2e
```

to run SYCL End-to-End tests on all devices configured in the system. Use

```
llvm-lit --param sycl_devices="backend0:device0[;backendN:deviceN]*" <repo_path>/sycl/test-e2e
```

to limit execution to particular devices, where `backend` is one of `opencl`,
`hip`, `cuda`, `level_zero`, and `device` is one of `cpu`, `gpu` or `acc`.

To run individual test use the path to it instead of the top level `test-e2e`
directory.

# Standalone configuration

This is supposed to be used for CI/automatic testing and isn't recommended for a
local development setup.

Get sources

```
git clone https://github.com/intel/llvm
cd llvm/sycl/test-e2e
mkdir build
cd build
```

With compiler tools available in the PATH:

```
# Configure
cmake \
 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
 -DSYCL_TEST_E2E_TARGETS="opencl:cpu" \
 ..

# Build and Run
make check-sycl-e2e
```

To use ninja build run as:

```
# Configure
cmake -G Ninja ...

# Build and Run
ninja check-sycl-e2e
```

# Cmake parameters

These parameters can be used to configure tests:

***CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER*** - path to DPCPP compiler

***TEST_SUITE_LLVM_SIZE*** - path to llvm-size tool, required for code size
collection

collection

***LLVM_LIT*** - path to llvm-lit tool

***SYCL_TEST_E2E_TARGETS*** - defines selection of multiple SYCL backends with
set of target devices per each to be tested iteratively. Value is
semicolon-separated list of configurations. Each configuration includes backend
separated from comma-separated list of target devices with colon. Example:

```
-DSYCL_TEST_E2E_TARGETS="opencl:cpu;level_zero:gpu;cuda:gpu;hip:gpu"
```

***OpenCL_LIBRARY*** - path to OpenCL ICD loader library. OpenCL
interoperability tests require OpenCL ICD loader to be linked with. For such
tests OpenCL ICD loader library should be installed in the system or available
at the full path specified by this variable.

***LEVEL_ZERO_INCLUDE*** - path to Level Zero headers.

***LEVEL_ZERO_LIBS_DIR*** - path to Level Zero libraries.

***CUDA_INCLUDE*** - path to CUDA headers.

Defaults to AMD if no value is given. Supported values are:
 - **AMD**    - for HIP to target AMD GPUs
 - **NVIDIA** - for HIP to target NVIDIA GPUs
 
***AMD_ARCH*** - flag may be set for when using HIP AMD triple. For example it
may be set to "gfx906". Otherwise must be provided via the ***amd_arch*** LIT
parameter (e.g., ***--param amd_arch=gfx906***) at runtime via the command line
or via the ***LIT_OPTS*** environment variable.

***GPU_AOT_TARGET_OPTS*** - defines additional options which are passed to AOT
compilation command line for GPU device. If not specified "-device *" value
is used.

# Special test categories

There are two special directories for extended testing. See documentation at:

 - [ExtraTests](ExtraTests/README.md)
 - [External](External/README.md)

# Creating or modifying tests

## LIT feature checks

Following features can be checked in tests to limit test execution to the
specific environment via REQUIRES, UNSUPPORTED, etc. filters. For example if
REQUIRES:sycl-ls specified, test will run only if sycl-ls tool is available.
If UNSUPPORTED:sycl-ls specified, test will run only if sycl-ls tool is
unavailable.

 * **windows**, **linux** - host OS;
 * **cpu**, **gpu**, **accelerator** - target device;
 * **cuda**, **hip**, **opencl**, **level_zero** - target backend;
 * **sycl-ls** - sycl-ls tool availability;
 * **cm-compiler** - C for Metal compiler availability;
 * **cl_options** - CL command line options recognized (or not) by compiler;
 * **opencl_icd** - OpenCL ICD loader availability;
 * **aot_tool** - Ahead-of-time compilation tools availability;
 * **ocloc**, **opencl-aot** - Specific AOT tool availability;

## llvm-lit parameters

Following options can be passed to llvm-lit tool through --param option to
configure specific single test execution in the command line:

 * **dpcpp_compiler** - full path to dpcpp compiler;
 * **sycl_devices** - `"backend0:device0[;backendN:deviceN]*"` where `backend`
    is one of `opencl`, `hip`, `cuda`, `level_zero` and `device` is one of
    `cpu`, `gpu` or `acc`.
 * **dump_ir** - if IR dumping is supported for compiler (True, False);

Example:

```
llvm-lit --param dpcpp_compiler=path/to/clang++ --param dump_ir=True \
         SYCL/External/RSBench
```

## sycl/detail/core.hpp

While SYCL specification dictates that the only user-visible interface is
`<sycl/sycl.hpp>` header file we found out that as the implementation and
multiple extensions grew, the compile time was getting worse and worse,
negatively affecting our CI turnaround time. We are just starting some efforts
to create a much smaller set of basic feature needed for every SYCL end-to-end
test/program so that this issue could be somewhat mitigated. This activity is in
its early stage and NO production code should rely on it. It WILL be changed as
we go with our experiments. For any code outside of this project only the
`<sycl/sycl.hpp>` must be used until we feel confident to propose an extension
that can provide an alternative.

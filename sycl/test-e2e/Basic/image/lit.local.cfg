# There is a SPIR-V spec issue that blocks generation of valid SPIR-V code for
# the OpenCL environments support of the "Unknown" image format:
# https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Headers/issues/487
# After the issue is resolved we will re-enable Image support.
#
# Legacy images aren't supported on AMD and also don't compile, so mark them
# unsupported here. Bindless images should be used instead.

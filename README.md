DPC++ is an open, cross-architecture language built upon the ISO C++ and Khronos
SYCL\* standards. DPC++ extends these standards with a number of extensions,
which can be found in [sycl/doc/extensions](sycl/doc/extensions) directory.

This is an example work-flow and configuration to get and build the LLVM source:

1. Checkout LLVM (including related sub-projects like Clang):

     * ``git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git``

     * Or, on windows, ``git clone --config core.autocrlf=false
    https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git``

2. Configure and build LLVM and Clang:

     * ``cd llvm-project``

     * ``cmake -S llvm -B build -G <generator> [options]``

        Some common build system generators are:

        * ``Ninja`` --- for generating [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org)
          build files. Most llvm developers use Ninja.
        * ``Unix Makefiles`` --- for generating make-compatible parallel makefiles.
        * ``Visual Studio`` --- for generating Visual Studio projects and
          solutions.
        * ``Xcode`` --- for generating Xcode projects.

        Some common options:

        * ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS='...'`` and ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES='...'`` ---
          semicolon-separated list of the LLVM sub-projects and runtimes you'd like to
          additionally build. ``LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS`` can include any of: clang,
          clang-tools-extra, cross-project-tests, flang, libc, libclc, lld, lldb,
          mlir, openmp, polly, or pstl. ``LLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES`` can include any of
          libcxx, libcxxabi, libunwind, compiler-rt, libc or openmp. Some runtime
          projects can be specified either in ``LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS`` or in
          ``LLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES``.

          For example, to build LLVM, Clang, libcxx, and libcxxabi, use
          ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang" -DLLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES="libcxx;libcxxabi"``.

        * ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=directory`` --- Specify for *directory* the full
          path name of where you want the LLVM tools and libraries to be installed
          (default ``/usr/local``). Be careful if you install runtime libraries: if
          your system uses those provided by LLVM (like libc++ or libc++abi), you
          must not overwrite your system's copy of those libraries, since that
          could render your system unusable. In general, using something like
          ``/usr`` is not advised, but ``/usr/local`` is fine.

        * ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=type`` --- Valid options for *type* are Debug,
          Release, RelWithDebInfo, and MinSizeRel. Default is Debug.

        * ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=On`` --- Compile with assertion checks enabled
          (default is Yes for Debug builds, No for all other build types).

      * ``cmake --build build [-- [options] <target>]`` or your build system specified above
        directly.

        * The default target (i.e. ``ninja`` or ``make``) will build all of LLVM.

        * The ``check-all`` target (i.e. ``ninja check-all``) will run the
          regression tests to ensure everything is in working order.

        * CMake will generate targets for each tool and library, and most
          LLVM sub-projects generate their own ``check-<project>`` target.

        * Running a serial build will be **slow**.  To improve speed, try running a
          parallel build.  That's done by default in Ninja; for ``make``, use the option
          ``-j NNN``, where ``NNN`` is the number of parallel jobs, e.g. the number of
          CPUs you have.

      * For more information see [CMake](https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html)

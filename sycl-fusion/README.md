# SYCL Kernel Fusion Compiler

Basic JIT compiler infrastructure to perform online kernel fusion of SYCL kernels at runtime.

The experimental SYCL extension for kernel fusion is described in 
[this proposal](../sycl/doc/extensions/experimental/sycl_ext_codeplay_kernel_fusion.asciidoc).

The design of the JIT compiler is described in this 
[design document](../sycl/doc/design/KernelFusionJIT.md).

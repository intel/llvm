# Security Policy

Intel is committed to rapidly addressing security vulnerabilities affecting our
customers and providing clear guidance on the solution, impact, severity and
mitigation.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

`intel/llvm` project is based upon the upstream
[`llvm/llvm-project`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) and leverages lots
of functionality provided by it. If an issue you found concerns functionality
which is available in upstream, then it is more efficient to directly report it
there, see corresponding `SECURITY.md` for their policy.

If you are unsure, or if you know that the issue is specific to additions
developed in `intel/llvm`, then please report any security vulnerabilities
[utilizing the guidelines here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/vulnerability-handling-guidelines.html).

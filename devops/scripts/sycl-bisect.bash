# This is a script for running git-bisect on sycl, sycl-web, and sycl pulldown
# branches. This is mostly a standard git-bisect, except that any upstream
# commits that aren't sycl-based must be merged to a sycl-based branch before
# being tested. When possible, this is done in a secondary worktree to avoid
# clobbering files, which enables incremental builds and significantly improves
# build times nearer to the end of the bisection.

# Parse options.

Usage:

$0 [opts] <bad commit> <good commits...>

  -h,--help                       Print this help message
  -t,--test <test>                Test commits with LIT test <test>, a test file
                                  path relative to the current working directory
  -c,--command <command>          Test commits with command <command>, which
                                  will be executed for each commit via bash -c
                                  in the current working directory
  -b,--command-allow-bisect-codes Pass 125 and >127 return codes to git-bisect
                                  directly when using --command to allow the
                                  command to skip commits or stop bisection. If
                                  this option is not present, any non-zero
                                  return value is interpreted as a bad commit.

Examples:

"Clang :: SemaSYCL/accessor_inheritance.cpp" started failing on sycl-web because
of one of the commits merged by 96f730774ac4. To find which one of these 96
commits caused this test failure, sycl-bisect.bash can be run like this:

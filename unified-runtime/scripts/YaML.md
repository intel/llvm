This document describes the YaML format used by the scripts for the API specifications.

## Input Structure
* The scripts search for all `.yml` files in the folders specified in `config.ini`.
* Each yml file represents a collection of APIs to be generated.
  * It is recommended that each yml file represents a single feature definition, but this is not required.
  * However, each extensions definition must be limited to a single yml file.
* The name of the yml file will be used as C++ `#pragma region` name in the specification.

## YML Syntax
* Each document in the yml file represents an entry in the specification.
* Every document must have a `type` scalar: {`header`, `macro`, `typedef`, `const`, `enum`, `struct`, `handle`, `function`, `class`}
* All scalars must be strings. The document writer is responsible for using explicit string notification where the yml parser may perform implicit conversion.
* Custom names must be tagged using `$` followed by the tag name. The tag names are defined in the `config.ini` section. There are two tag variations for replacement:
    - `$x` : lower_case
    - `$X` : ALL_CAPS

#### type: header
* Every yml file is required to have a header
* A header requires the following scalar fields: {`desc`}
  - `desc` will be used as the region description comment
* A header may take the following optional scalar fields: {`ordinal`, `version`}
  - `ordinal` will be used to override the default order (alphabetical) in which regions appear in the specification; `default="1000"`. Multiple regions with the same ordinal will be ordered alphabetically.
  - `version` can be used to define the minimum API version for all documents in the yml file; `default="1.0"`

#### type: macro
* A macro initiates the creation of a C/C++ preprocessor `#define` directive in the specification
* A macro requires the following scalar fields: {`desc`, `name`, `value`}
  - `desc` will be used as the macro's description comment
  - `name` must be a unique ISO-C standard identifier, start with `$` tag and be all caps
  - `name` may optionally contain an ISO-C preprocessor parameter list
  - `value` must be an ISO-C standard preprocessor replacement list
* A macro may take the following optional scalar fields: {`condition`, `altvalue`, `ordinal`, `version`}
  - `condition` will be used as a C/C++ preprocessor `#if` conditional expression
  - `altvalue` must be an ISO-C standard preprocessor replacement list. If specified, then will be contained within the `#else` conditional block.
  - `ordinal` will be used to override the default order (in which they appear) the macro appears within its section; `default="1000"`
  - `version` will be used to define the minimum API version in which the macro will appear; `default="1.0"` This will also affect the order in which the macro appears within its section.
* A macro may take the following optional field which can be a scalar, a sequence of scalars or scalars to sequences: {`details`}
  - `details` will be used as the macro's detailed comment

#### type: class
* A class initiates the creation of a C++ class declaration in the specification
* A class requires the following scalar fields: {`desc`, `name`}
  - `desc` will be used as the class's description comment
  - `name` must be a unique ISO-C standard identifier, start with `$` tag, and be PascalCase
* A class may take the following optional scalar fields: {`attribute`, `base`, `owner`, `condition`, `ordinal`, `version`}
  - `attribute` will be used to specify whether the class is a special-type: {`singleton`}
  - `base` will be used to specify the base type of the class
  - `owner` will be used to specify which other class creates this class
  - `condition` will be used as a C/C++ preprocessor `#if` conditional expression
  - `ordinal` will be used to override the default order (in which they appear) the class appears within its section; `default="1000"`
  - `version` will be used to define the minimum API version in which the class will appear; `default="1.0"` This will also affect the order in which the class appears within its section.
* A class requires the following sequence of mappings: {`members`}
  - A member requires the following scalar fields: {`desc`, `type`, `name`}
    + `desc` will be used as the members's description comment
    + `type` must be an ISO-C standard identifier
    + `name` must be a unique ISO-C standard identifier
  - A member may take the following optional scalar field: {`version`}
    + `version` will be used to define the minimum API version in which the member will appear; `default="1.0"` This will also affect the order in which the member appears within the class.
  - The first member must be the handle associated with the class; the `name` must be `"handle"`
  - If `owner` is specified, then the second member must be the pointer to the owner 
  - The next member may be the `_desc_t` used to create the object; the `name` must be `"desc"`
* A class may take the following optional field which can be a scalar, a sequence of scalars or scalars to sequences: {`details`}
  - `details` will be used as the class's detailed comment

## Extensions
* Each extensions must be defined in a unique `.yml` file
* The extension file must be added to the section being extended; i.e. extensions to core APIs must be added to the `core` folder, etc.
* The extension file must contain a macro that defines the extension name
* The extension file must contain a enum that defines the extension version(s)
* The extension must following the naming convention described in the programming guide
* The extension can add any document type allowed (macro, enum, structure, function, class, etc.)
